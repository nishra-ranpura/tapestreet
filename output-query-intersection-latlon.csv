"Victor José Victor Rojas was born in Santiago de los Caballeros. His professional life began in 1972, with the authorship of La Casita (The Little House), which he sang with Wilfrido Vargas. This piece became such a great success that it inspired the budding author to launch his career as a performer and composer, work that kept him busy for the rest of his life. In the 1970s, his dissatisfaction with domestic politics and economic policies in the Dominican Republic, added to increasing international turmoil, inspired him to write songs with social and political content as his aesthetic compass. Mr. Víctor also took part in the movement opposed to the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and he began to write protest songs. As a young man he traveled the country as part of youth groups protesting the government while receiving an education in local rhythms. Between 1973 and 1978, he founded and led the group Nueva Fortuna, with which he traveled all over the country. In 1978, he created the group Flamboyán, through which he projected his music as a sample of rhythmic intermixing. For five years he shared the stage with the most important figures of the Latin American song and performed in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Italy. Victor Victor studied the musical roots of merengue and bachata, recreated the genre and enriched it. Successes such as “Mesita de noche”, “Ando buscando un amor” y “Así es mi amor” were made with simplicity and beautiful metaphors and have been performed by leading Dominican and foreign vocalists. In 1990, he released his fourth album, entitled “Un chin de veneno”, which was an international success. It succesfully fuses Caribbean rhythms in a new style. Victor Victor has to his credit the long-running albums entitled “Álbum rojo”, “Flamboyan”, “Con sus flores y sus vainas”, “Cotidiano”, “Artistas por la paz”, “Inspiraciones”, “Tu corazón” y “Alma de Barrio”. In 2007, he recorded the social-themed album “Verde y negro” as a tribute to the freedom fighters of the Dominican Republic. Victor died of COVID-19 at a hospital in Santo Domingo at age 71. The artist was awarded the Awards: Premios A Lo Nuestro, Aplauso 92, Ronda, ACE, Aplauso 98, ASCAP and ONDA. Victor Victor remains a beloved and influential artist for hundreds of thousands of Dominicans in New York City. ",Manhattan,Intersection,1626537600000.0,Rodriguez,At the intersection of 176th Street and Fort Washington Avenue ,Victor Victor Way ,,10033.0,7553.0,Int.

"Joseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men who had avoided being captured then killed the guards and freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.

"Moshe Berkowitz was killed when a drunk driver was speeding down Ocean Avenue and ran a red light and crashed into Mr. Berkowitz’s car.  Moshe Berkowitz was a gifted instructor, mentor and energetic yeshiva teacher who was a role model in the community. He grew up at 1902 Avenue L, which was only two blocks from the accident.  Moshe was bilingual as he spoke both English and Hebrew at home. He went to local schools his entire life. Starting out at Mizrachi Lebanim (now known as Yeshiva Derech Hatorah), he went to a few schools after including Mirrer Yeshiva on Ave R and Ocean Parkway. When he was 12 years old, in fact just a few weeks from his bar mitzvah, his father at age 43 suffered a catastrophic stroke that rendered him paralyzed on one side of his body. Which meant at the age of 12, Moshe would need to become the man of the house per-se. Sure enough, a few months after his bar mitzvah, his mother moved back to her native Israel and left Moshe to fend for himself, his dad and his brother. This at the ripe old age of 13. While he had some help from his aunt and uncle, Moshe had to help in any way possible with his father. From the simplest things such as using the bathroom, to getting him dressed in the morning. This was Moshe's life until he eventually moved out of his father’s house later on. While all this turmoil in his life, Mo still maintained a straight path to success. He finished school and at the pushing of his Aunt, went to college. At the time of his death, he was finishing a degree in business management from Brooklyn College. Having previously graduated Kingsborough Community College and obtaining his Associates degree. To supplement income, he decided to do something he truly loved. He became a teacher at a school known for taking in troubled kids from the community. He knew he could connect to them as he had such a hard upbringing, and with this, he developed many relationships with these young men. He spent 3 years teaching 8th grade at the Yeshiva, Birchas Shmuel. During this time, he was involved not just during school hours, but spent many hours afterschool mentoring these boys by taking them out on trips, for food, and other fun activities. He knew how to reach them in ways nobody else could. ",Brooklyn,Intersection,1688572800000.0,Vernikov,At the intersection of Avenue N and Ocean Avenue,Moshe Berkowitz Way,,11230.0,7640.0,Int.

"This information is taken from an essay by Clarence Page.  It is located at http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/jan-june02/poverty_5-06.html.  

In 1965, Claude Brown gave poverty another face, a big city face, with his autobiographical novel Manchild in the Promised Land. Vivid, violent, and unsentimental, Brown called it a novel, but it was his story, beginning with him getting shot, and running from the cops. ""I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it."" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies.  

The '60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America's cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown's Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground.  

His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown's Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, ""which is still finding Claude Browns,"" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared.  

Claude Brown's story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the ""cycle of poverty,"" they said, for the ""urban underclass,"" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution.  

Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope.  

Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone's payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land.

It later bought two more buildings on the same block and has plans to build an education center. Mixon did more than preach.  He and other men in the congregation laid the cinder-block foundation for the new sanctuary after the original building was torn down.  In keeping with another tradition, members of the congregation accompanied Mixon when he walked the several blocks from his home to the church for the dedication ceremony.

"Antonio Nobile was born in Calatafimi, Sicily on January 26, 1928.  He was one of nine brothers.  Having only a 5th grade education, Tony began cutting hair at the age of 10, taking lessons from a local barber in his hometown.  At the age of 19, he moved to Florence to work for a Master Barber, a position he retained until leaving Italy.  Antonio married the love of his life, Antoinetta, on January 16, 1958.  Together they raised 5 children, 3 sons that were born in Florence, and 2 daughters that were born in Brooklyn.  

Tony came to the US on October 12, 1968, settling in Brooklyn.  After taking the Master Barber exam for New York State, a test he passed in only a few minutes, he opened his first barber shop in Bensonhurst.  In 1973, he opened his second shop in Dyker Heights, a business that became a fixture on 11th Avenue for the next three decades.  This shop not only served as a place where customers could get a haircut in less than 10 minutes, but a gathering place for the residents of the area to sit and discuss the political issues of the day.  Tony was such an institution in Dyker Heights that customers would continue patronizing his shop, or just stop by for a visit, even after moving out of the area. 

The Nobile family were parishioners of Regina Pacis Church.  His children all went to public school and college, something he was not able to do.  He was devoted to his family and generous to his customers. 

Antonio loved to travel, visiting his beloved Italy 5 times to visit his mother.  He loved to read and enjoyed watching soccer, basketball and boxing, but his main passion was always his barber shop.  Antonio was posthumously inducted into the Barbering Hall of Fame in Canal Winchester, Ohio in September, 2004.  With over 90,000 barbers in the United States, this honor is only bestowed upon 3 people per year.

"This co-naming will commemorate the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic; Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and Matías Ramón Mella.  

Juan Pablo Duarte (January 26, 1813 - July 15, 1876) is considered a national hero of the Dominican Republic, who led the Trinitaria Movement formed in 1838, that led to its eventual liberation in 1844. As a young scholar, Duarte finished his studies in Europe, and upon returning to the Dominican Republic, he shared his liberal ideologies. His vast knowledge allowed him to be one of the architects in the formation of a liberated country. Duarte was exiled twice from the Dominican Republic, and in his absence of 1844, Ramon Matias Mella, was in charge of leading the revolution of Independence. He fought to liberate the Dominican Republic from Spain. 

Francisco del Rosario Sanchez (March 9, 1817 - July 4, 1861) initiated his revolutionary career by joining the secret society “La Trinitaria” in 1838, a group that sought to fight against occupation of the Dominican Republic. In 1844, Sanchez wrote The Manifesto of Independence, which led him to become the head of the Junta de Gobierno. On February 27th, alongside Mella and Duarte’s brother, Vicente Duarte, they declared independence of the Dominican Republic. 

Ramon Matias Mella (February 25, 1816 - June 4, 1864) was a revolutionary, patriot leader, militant general, and politician mostly known for firing the shot of independence on February 27th, 1844 in Puerta del Conde. As a militant and revolutionary, Mella was one of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic and was one of the establishers of the First Republic and the Restoration. He also served as the 7th Vice President from 1863-1864, and created the 1864 Guerrilla Warfare Manual in order to combat the Spanish forces that overtook the Dominican Republic.

He is commonly referred to as the honorific Allama, meaning very knowing and most learned. He was born in Punjab, Pakistan. Before Muhammad Ali Jinnah established Pakistan, Allama Iqbal foresaw its creation. He had a vision of a culturally and politically independent land that promoted the ideals of Muslims residing in British-ruled India. Allama Iqbal sought to create a free Muslim State to combat the oppression and discrimination that Muslim faced residing in India. The dissemination of western thought and the concepts of democracy were a core foundation in encouraging Allama Iqbal to organize this movement. Similar to those ideals held in the United States constitution, Allama Iqbal wanted a Muslim State that promoted the ideologies of Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness.

"John Jay McKelvey, Sr. was an American author, attorney, and preservationist who set precedents in establishing the Harvard Law Review and in framing case law to craft the environs of his Spuyten Duyvil community, New York. He also built the Villa Rosa Bonheur’s sisters, the Villa Charlotte Brontë and Villa Victoria around the same time, was alarmed by the wave of high-rise “city ugly” development spreading through New York City at the time. His answer was to construct cooperative apartments resembling villas, the famous “City Beautiful” movement of the early twentieth century. Mr. McKelvey’s legacy in Spuyten Duyvil includes not just the three “Villas” (Rosa Bonheur, Charlotte Brontë and Victoria but also as the secretary and director of the two entities the Along-the-Hudson Company and the Edgehill Terrace Company, the development footprints of each are still apparent today. He was an attorney for the Edgehill Co-Operative Savings & Loan Association; member of the Contracts and Bronx, and Executive Committees of the Hudson–Fulton Celebration Commission of 1909; secretary of the Henry Hudson Monument Committee of 1909; founding member, trustee and incorporator of the Edgehill Church, attorney, secretary, the District Protective League and as trustee of the Barnard School for Boys (now part of Horace Mann School). At the turn of the twentieth Century, the Park District Protective League (PDPL) was an organization of exclusivity, but over the years took on a preservationist role in Riverdale. Riverdale Park was created by the contributions of landowners convinced by the PDPL of the need to protect the green space from the encroaching development of the city. In the 1950’s, the PDPL became the Riverdale Community Planning Association, which went on to champion the rezoning of Riverdale and the environmental protections of the Special Natural Area District regulations. Without the stewardship and influence of John McKelvey, Sr. in those early years, it is quite possible that Riverdale would be a very different place from the place we call home today. His contribution to the modern development of the Spuyten Duyvil community was noted in obituaries both local and national, when he passed away in 1947 at the age of 84. His practice of law included a preservationist vision which resonates today in the picturesque tranquility of our green space and our sustained commitment to a planned and balanced community, and for this inspiration we owe him great thanks. ",Bronx,Intersection,1657900800000.0,Dinowitz,At the intersection of Independence Avenue and Palisade Avenue ,John McKelvey Sr. Way Villa Rosa Bonheur ,,10463.0,7818.0,Int.

"Johnny Ventura modernized merengue during the early 1960s. He was a dancer, bandleader, arranger, and composer who released more than 100 albums. He was a six-time Latin Grammy winner who influenced virtually every merengue singer who followed him. Fascinated by the energy and dance moves in early rock & roll music -- especially Elvis Presley's -- Ventura grafted them onto merengue on early albums such as 1965's El Boogaloo Esta en Algo and 1966's Figurando. By 1970, he was a best-selling artist across Latin America who performed sold-out concerts in the U.S. and Europe. He embraced salsa during the early '70s and registered hits with Salsa y Algo Más (1971), Salsa Pa Tu Lechón (1972), and 1973's Salsa, but he never abandoned merengue. During the first half of the '80s he scored hits with El Sueño (1982) and the merengue suite collection El Hombre y Su Musica in 1985. He dissolved his band in 1992 to pursue a career in politics but in 2002 he resumed touring and recording. He continued to release charting albums such as 2006's 103 Boulevard, 2013's El Viejo 'Ta en la Calle, and 2016's Tronco Viejo. Johnny Ventura was born Juan de Dios Ventura Sorian in the city of La Vega in the Dominican Republic. At 16 he enrolled at Ercina Chevalier Commercial Institute to earn a secretary's degree and find a job that would fund his university studies. That changed when he accepted a friend's challenge and entered a talent contest on the radio program La Voz de la Alegria. He won. He also competed on the TV show La TV Busca Una Estrella (Star Search) and won. His prize was a scholarship to study music and voice. After graduation he changed his name to Johnny Ventura and auditioned for and won the job as lead singer in Rondón Votau's orchestra. In 1961 he joined percussionist Donald Wild's group before moving on to Combo Caribe de Luis Pérez in January of 1962. Ventura scored his first hit for the bandleader with ""La Agarradera,"" a song full of double entendres that would have been impossible to release just a year before when military dictator Rafael Trujillo ruled the country with an iron fist. The flipside of the single was ""Care con el Cuabero,"" a Ventura composition. Interestingly, Ventura left Pérez's employ to join Papa Molina's La Super Orquesta San José. They didn't record at all, but they were easily the most popular dance band in Santo Domingo at the time. The tenure with Molina made Ventura a certified star in the city, and others saw his potential. Cuban promoter Angel Guinea prodded him into forming his own group, Johnny Ventura y Su Combo Show, and helped him inject a bit of Las Vegas floor-show glitz and glamour into his presentation. Ventura was obsessed with the energy of American rock & roll performers such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. He loved the slick dance moves Elvis brought to his performances and grafted that genre's kinetic force and the innovative movements to the Combo Show, a band that launched the careers of Dominican stars such as Luisito Marti, Fausto Rey, and Anthony Rios. Ventura cut 1964's El Lloron under his own name for New York's tiny independent Remo Records. He then signed a deal with Phonogram in early 1965 for Johnny Ventura y Su Combo Show. They released three successful albums for the label, including La Coquetona and La Resbalosa (both 1965), and Siempre Pa' Lante (1966). Though a star at home, Ventura was restless for new experiences. He and his Combo Show traveled to New York City in 1966 and began playing dancehalls and concerts. His energy and the band's stellar musicianship wowed audiences and word spread quickly. They cut and released Figurando later that year. Its revved-up boogaloo reading of Mexican folk song ""La Bamba"" and lush merengue version of ""Strangers in the Night"" drove the album straight to a gold certification. By the time he released El Turun, Tun, Tun in early 1967, he was melding merengue with guaguancó, descarga, and early salsa. The record buying public -- thanks to Latin radio in the Caribbean and the U.S. -- bought it in droves. Ventura toured across the U.S, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. He dug into boogaloo and soul on 1968's now classic El Mamito and offered a further evolved brand of merengue on El Papelito Bronco. In 1969, he delivered Siempre en Orbita, melding merengue, salsa, and guaguancó; it ran straight up to the top of the Latin charts. 1971's Ah! Yo No Sé... No was an instant hit (it reprised that status when it was reissued for the first time in 1976 and re-entered the charts). Its title-track single won airplay all over North, Central, and South America, and the album was certified platinum. Its appeal lies in Ventura's perfect integration of contemporary merengue with salsa, guajira, and Caribbean-styled cumbia. For the remainder of the decade, Johnny Ventura y Su Combo Show couldn't miss the charts if they tried. They released no less than 20 albums that decade. Among them were some of his greats such as 1973's Luisito Marti con Johnny Ventura y Su Combo, El Pingüino, and Salsa y Algo Más, 1974's La Protesta de Los Feos, 1975's live En Accion, Salsa, and El Hijo del Pueblo. In 1977, due to constant recording and touring, conflicts arose within the band. Ventura wrangled three more charting albums from them that year -- 2 Ases al Tiro featuring Rolando Laserie, Excitante, and the compilation Johnny Ventura y Su Combo Show -- then left temporarily to create a new orchestra, Los Caballos de Johnny Ventura. When his longtime friend José Francisco Peña Gomez, died of cancer in the middle of a mayoral campaign, Ventura replaced him in the mayoral race at the suggestion of the party. He won and served as Santo Domingo's mayor from 1998 to 2002 during a particularly difficult time in its economic history. While he still performed on occasion, his only releases were compilations. He returned to recording with 2003's Sin Desperdicio. It took home the Latin Grammy for best merengue album. He followed with 103 Boulevard and ¡Oye Qué Rico Mami...Salsa! The albums placed at four and six respectively on the Tropical Albums chart and Ventura was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Latin Grammy Foundation. In 2010 he issued the hit holiday set Volvio La Navidad and followed with 2013's sparkling merengue/salsa set El Viejo 'Ta en la Calle and Frente a Frente, the latter a collaborative album with Milly Quezadathat peaked at 15. Ventura's final studio album was 2016's Tronco Viejo, which featured the great singer in duets with Romeo Santos, Silvio Rodriguez, Edesio Alejandro, and the Buena Vista Social Club's Omara Portuondo. It reached number 14 on the Tropical albums chart. In 2020, Ventura ran for mayor of Santo Domingo again but lost. ",Manhattan,Intersection,1657987200000.0,Rodriguez,At the intersection of Wadsworth and 176th Street in the borough of Manhattan ,Johnny Ventura Way ,,10033.0,7874.0,Int.

"On July 29th, 1998, Jerome Robbins died of a stroke in his home in New York City. He was one of the first great American-born ballet masters and also a major Broadway and film choreographer, winning four Tony Awards and two Academy Awards.  

He was born Jerome Rabinowitz, October 11, 1918, son of Jewish immigrants. As a child he studied the piano and violin as well as dance. He studied ballet with Ula Duganova, Eugene Loring, and Anthony Tudor; modern dance with the New Dance League; interpretive dance with Sonya Robbins; Spanish dance with Helene Viola; and Oriental dance with Nimura, and in 1940 he joined American Ballet Theater as a dancer. In 1942 he choreographed his first ballet, Fancy Free , which recounts the adventures of three young sailors on leave. His style combined more popular dance styles with classical ballet in a way that was new at the time. In 1948 Balanchine invited him to join the newly created New York City Ballet, and in 1950 he received a Dance Magazine Award for his interpretation of Balanchine's Prodigal Son.  

From 1944 to 1964 he became famous beyond the world of ballet, choreographing for such Broadway musicals as On The Town, Peter Pan, The King and I, West Side Story, and Fiddler on the Roof. It was perhaps with West Side Story , collaborating with Leonard Bernstein, that he reached the pinnacle of his show business career. His dances for the Sharks and the Jets captured the restless spirit and violence of gang warfare.  

Leaving Broadway behind him, he returned to ballet after 1964. In his career with City Ballet he created some 50 ballets that testify to the diversity of his talent and confirm his place as a 20th century ballet master. In Afternoon of a Faun, created in 1953, he demonstrated his command of the neo-classicism with this cool and mysterious reinventing of Nyjinski's ballet. The Concert created in 1956, is a comic spoof of a classical music concert. Many of his ballets like Dances at a Gathering, have become part of the repertory of companies around the world. After the death of Balanchine in 1983, he shared the post of artistic director of The New York City Ballet with Peter Martins until 1990. He was considered by the dancers as an uncompromising taskmaster.  

In 1981 he received a Kennedy Center Award. He returned briefly to Broadway in 1989 with an anthology of past hits entitled Jerome Robbin's Broadway. His dedication to dance will live on in his ballets.

"Miguel Angel Amadeo was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico and was the son of composer Alfredo “Titi” Amadeo.  In 1948, he moved to New York and settled in the Bronx.  As a composer and guitarist, his first bolero, “Cruel desilusión” was recorded in 1954 and in the early 1950s he founded the group Trío Los Tres Reyes.  He composed boleros and guarachas and his songs have been recorded by Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo, Danny Rivera and Hector Lavoe, among others.  He worked for Bartolo Alvarez in his famous store in El Barrio, Casa Latina.  Later he worked for Barolo’s nephew, Al Santiago, at his Bronx music store Casalegre, and for his record label, Alegre. Amadeo bought Casa Hernández at 786 Prospect Avenue in 1969 and managed the store under the name Casa Amadeo.  During the 1980s when the neighborhood was falling apart, he kept the store going, even when he was the only tenant in the building.

In 1975, he cleaned up and abandoned lot on Brook Avenue and 158th Street which started a movement in the South Bronx that made Melrose the neighborhood with the largest concentration of community gardens and casitas. Rincon Criollo has held numerous community gatherings, musical performances and other cultural festivities. Early on, it became a cultural center for musicians to perform Bomba y Plena lessons, as well learn instrument making from Chema and other members. Bomba y Plena lessons were taught for free to people of all ages within the community. Soto became a mentor to many through his teachings of songs and playing of instruments. While he was known as the man who built Rincon Criollo, he also had a hand (literally) in most of the other local casitas in the Melrose neighborhoods. He changed the landscape and the soundscape of the community with his casita as the leading site on the mainland for Puerto Rican music. After years of gardening, taking care of the land, planting fruits and vegetables – grapes, peaches, cabbages, green peppers, tomatoes and more, he enjoyed distributing items to the community at no cost. The community still comes to pick fresh fruits and vegetables from the garden. In 1987, the Casita de Chema joined the city’s Green Thumb Community Garden Program. He created the blueprint for the Gardenhaus Green Thumb Guidebook with step by step instructions on how to build a casita. In 1990, the Bronx Council of the Arts held a landmark exhibition called “Casitas” where Chema, along with others, went to build replicas of casitas that were showcased at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., Hostos Community College, and the Bronx Museum in tribute to Puerto Rican culture. Rincon Criollo joined with Hostos CC’s Center for the Arts and Culture in establishing the biennial Bomplenzo festival in 2000, which traditionally includes the closing event, “Vente-Tu” at the casita.

"The Bronx is also known as El Condado de la Salsa. When you talk to old school salsa aficionados, they will fondly talk about Fania, a record label that made Afro-Cubanbased dance music a worldwide phenomenon. This was embodied at the August 24, 1973, Fania All-Stars concert at Yankee Stadium which featured some of the top Salsa performers. Fania was the brainchild of former New York City police officer and divorce lawyer from Brooklyn, Jerry Masucci and his partner, Dominican bandleader and flautist, Johnny Pacheco who grew up in the Mott Haven district of The Bronx. Formed in 1964 the music that the Fania label produced was considered revolutionary. In its formative years they were producing music with Afro-Cuban rhythms played by Latinos in New York City, the majority of which were Nuyoricans (New Yorkers of Puerto Rican descent). The term “salsa” had been bandied about before and used in songs since Septeto Nacional recorded “Echalé Salsita” in Cuba in the 1930s. However, the word gained currency after the U.S. embargo against Cuba when Masucci and Pacheco adopted it to describe the music their label produced. Fania literally spread “salsa” by releasing the movies, Our Latin Thing (1972) and Salsa (1975), both directed by Leon Gast. In bringing “salsa” to the community, the label was up against young Latinos in New York City who had come of age in the 1960s and weren’t into the big band mambo sounds of their parents, however, they were inspired by the R&B and rock and roll of AM radio and the British invasion. So in the late ‘60s the young Latino community began listening (and creating) Latin bugalú which was a fusion of African-American R&B and Afro-Cuban music, particularly cha cha chá and son montuno. This music had none of the sophistication of the Afro-Cuban jazz and mambo performed by the Three Mambo Kings—Machito, Tito Puente, and Tito Rodríguez— and it was sung in English. By 1968, with industry insiders and established bandleaders of the old guard refusing to accept it, bugalú began to fade and the sounds of Fania enervated the young Latino community. The Afro-Cuban rhythms remained in the forefront, but the musical arrangements leaned toward either the old guard Cuban conjunto sound or the more updated New York City power trombone style with trumpets. The music, once again sung in Spanish, reconnected many to their culture. Musical icons, that are still revered today recorded and performed for Fania: Ray Barretto, Cheo Feliciano, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colón, Larry Harlow, Roberto Roena, Rubén Blades, Celia Cruz, La Sonora Ponceña, Pete “El Conde” Rodríguez, Adalberto Santiago, Ismael Miranda, Yomo Toro, and Barry Rogers to name just a few. Musicians from The Bronx played a significant role in Fania and were members of the Fania All-Stars (the label’s super group). Johnny Pacheco, Pete “El Conde,” Willie Colón, Eddie Montalvo, Nicky Marrero, and Ray Barretto grew up in The Bronx. Yomo Toro and Hector Lavoe migrated from Puerto Rico. La Lupe was from Cuba. But they all settled here. Performers who graced the stage with the Fania All-Stars such as Mongo Santamaria also made The Bronx their home at one point in their lives. The Bronx’s soundscape has new Latino music sounds including the Dominican bachata, but salsa still remains a part of the borough’s legacy and identity.",Bronx,Intersection,1688313600000.0,"Salamanca, Jr.",At the intersection of 155th Street and Third Avenue,El Condado de la Salsa Way,,10455.0,7912.0,Int.

In 1979, he opened a social club called the “Green House,” to give the people a place to relax. He would offer food, drinks, and entertainment to escape the negative world around them. He started block parties that grew over the years to celebrate the people in the community. He would build a stage out of old doors he collected, and the youth took on leadership roles with organizing the events. These block parties were the foundation for many of the major events in the Bronx.

"Ismail Qemali was a leader of the Albanian national movement. As founder of Independent Albania, he served as its first head of state and president of the provisional government until January 1914 when he was forced to step aside by the International Commission of Control established by the six Great Powers. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, he became a deputy in the restored Ottoman Parliament, working with liberal politicians and the British. In 1909, during a rising against the Young Turks, he was briefly made President of the Ottoman National Assembly but was forced to leave Constantinople forever a day or two later. Thereafter his political career concentrated solely on Albanian nationalism. The Athens embassy of the Ottoman Empire reported that Qemali negotiated with organization financed by wealthy Tosks and Greece about forging a union. He was a principal figure in the Albanian Declaration of Independence and the formation of the independent Albania on 28 November 1912. This signaled the end of almost 500 years of Ottoman rule in Albania. Together with Luigj Gurakuqi, he raised the flag on the balcony of the two-story building in Vlorë where the Declaration of Independence had just been signed. The establishment of the government was postponed for the fourth session of the Assembly of Vlorë, held on 4 December 1912, until representatives of all regions of Albania arrived to Vlore. Qemali was prime minister of Albania from 1912 to 1914. In November 1913, Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the Albanian throne to the Ottoman war minister of Albanian origin, Izzet Pasha. The Ottoman Empire sent agents to encourage a revolt, hoping to restore Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. Izzet Pasha sent major Beqir Grebenali, another ethnic Albanian, to be one of his chief representatives in Albania. The Provisional Government of Albania under control of Ismail Qemali captured and executed major Beqir Grebenali. Such provocative and damaging display of independence of Qemali's government angered Great Powers and International Commission of Control forced Qemali to step aside and leave Albania. During World War I, Ismail Qemali lived in exile in Paris, where, though short of funds, he maintained a wide range of contacts and collaborated with the correspondent of the continental edition of the Daily Mail, Somerville Story, to write his memoirs. ",Staten Island,Intersection,1688918400000.0,Carr,At the intersection of Seaview Avenue and Father Capodanno Boulevard,Ismail Qemali Way,,10305.0,7982.0,Int.

She also managed the payroll and was accountable for 25 schools in School District 30. She retired from the New York City Board of Education in 1995. She always had an entrepreneurial spirit and deep commitment to her community. She owned a resort and children’s camp which she called Moodie’s Lodge in Moodus, Connecticut, which served communities of all ethnicities to spend quality time with their families while they enjoyed the great outdoors during the summer months. She served as a Girl Scout Leader for five years at the First Baptist Church in Corona, was an election inspector in the neighborhood, supervised the Saturday educational program for children in Corona at Grace Episcopal Church, owned and operated Big City Realty, which help provide residence for low income families in Corona, and provided daycare services for working mothers in Corona. She was involved in other community efforts including supporting the Flushing Meadow Soap Box Derby and collecting toys for disabled children at Goldwater Hospital.

"Julie Lobbia was a remarkable advocate and journalist, who reminded her readers of the original muckrakers; humanists who sought out the truth through their writing and reporting.  J.A.  Lobbia, as she was better known, through her Village Voice column “Towers and Tenements,” tirelessly dug up information and pursued stories and leads that would show what was really going on for tenants in New York.  Lobbia’s journalism – and its incredible advocacy for the rights of tenants all over New York City – has had an immeasurable impact on our City.  It is for this lifetime of accomplishment that Manhattan Community Board No. 5 has approved naming a stretch of the bike lane on Sixth Avenue in her honor. 

When J.A. Lobbia went to work, she put her heart and soul into it.  Her “Towers and Tenements” column covered the City’s affordable housing crisis, the State’s weakening of rent regulation laws, the strident efforts of the tenants’ movements, and exposed the shameful ways of certain slumlords and developers.  

A true sign that someone really cares about an issue is his or her dedication, even after the workday is done.  When J.A. Lobbia would be biking through neighborhoods, she would take notice eviction notices and stop to give advice if she could.  She even noticed an eviction notice written in Chinese, had it translated so that she could read it, wrote a response, had it translated back into Chinese, and slipped it under the door.  Also, she actively volunteered her time at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, and as a tutor in the Immigrant Literacy Project of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart. 

For her efforts and diligent dedication to journalism, Lobbia received many awards.  Among these are the 2001 Front Page Award from the Newswomen’s Club of NY, Scales of Justice Media Award from Mobilization for Youth Legal Services, Best Columnist Award from the Society of Professional Journalism, and a Golden Typewriter Award for Public Interest in Journalism. 

J.A. Lobbia was not only an intelligent, capable journalist, but she was a selfless person who gave back to the society her heart and hand.  She unfortunately died from cancer in 2001 at the young age of 43.  Even throughout her illness, Lobbia continued to be out on the streets, getting stories and helping other people. 

Although known and admired by most for her work on tenants rights, J.A. Lobbia was involved in other issues.  Among those were transportation and traffic, in that she was an avid cyclist.  When she was sick, she was quoted as saying that when she died, she would want to be “buried in a dress and bike shoes.”  For a person who gave so much to the tenants of New York City, there seems no better tribute than naming a bike lane in her honor.

"Joe Chiodi was a staple of the Pelham Parkway community. He consistently sacrificed everyone else before himself. From his humble beginnings in a small town outside of Naples, Italy, he immigrated to America as a young boy and with his hard work, was able to start his own restaurant. It’s difficult to put into words how many lives he touched with over the forty years he owned and operated John & Joe’s Pizzeria. He treated every child that came into his store like family, often times giving them their very first job. He was more than a man behind the counter serving slices of pizza. He cared for blind members of his community, he gave free slices to children who couldn’t pay, and many times, he gave a long stern talk to children that lost their path. He sponsored the local little league teams, offered his spare generator to families who had children in need of medical equipment, and in times of natural disaster, was often the only shop on the block that was still open and serving the community however he could.

"Shri Guru Ravidass Marg was born in Banaras, Uttar Pradesh, India. He attained recognition as a most learned Guru who was a great thinker, reformist, traveler, spiritual leader, and poet. Ravidass was an Indian mystic poet-saint of the Bhakti movement during the 15th to 16th century AD. Venerated as a guru (teacher) in the region of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh, the devotional songs of Ravidass have had a lasting impact on the Bhakti movement. He was a great social reformer. He fought the caste system in India with great courage when the caste system was at its peak. Upper Caste Kings became his followers. He was born in the CHAMAR caste. The chamars are a Dalit (formerly ""untouchable"") caste group numerically prevalent across North India, traditionally associated with leatherwork and animal carcass disposal, connoting ritual impurity according to the Hindu religious system of caste hierarchy. In the face of enduring discrimination by wider Indian society, a sense of collective identity and solidarity remains strong amongst chamars. The Ravidassi movement promised a collective religious identity for chamars outside the existing socio-religious order. Centered around the Punjabi city of Jalandhar, this movement has seen temples constructed across North India, including in the sacred Hindu city of Varanasi. Through these temples, religious leaders and reformers have promoted a separatist religious identity for Ravidassis, one that rejects the ritually impure status afforded to chamars as leatherworkers by Hindu cosmology.

"Paul Ramos was born in Harlem on April 26, 1941.  After the tragic death of his father, Paul lived with his grandmother in East Harlem.  Paul received his education in a Catholic elementary school and public high school.  At the age of 17, Paul’s grandmother passed away, leaving him to arrange sleeping in relatives and friends homes.  At one point, Paul stayed with Langston Hughes, where Paul Ramos learned about music and refined his taste in jazz and poetry. 

From 1960-1963, Paul worked at the Veterans Administration Hospital as an Operating Room Technician.  In 1964 he began work as a trainer at a management-engineering firm.  Because of his background in hospital work, he was assigned to monitor proprietary health institutions and related agencies that included nursing homes, private clinics and group practices.  In 1965 he began working for several Lower East Side community organizations, where he counseled “problem children” and obtained private funds for reading and tutoring programs.  He educated parents in health care delivery and how to avail themselves of the resources in the community. 

In 1966 he accepted a position in the Community Development and Education Department of the Gouverneur Health Services Program.  In this capacity, he monitored the delivery of health care to patients and organized a crisis intervention unit, focused on welfare, housing and relocation of families.  Paul devoted the rest of his life to the nurturing and growth of what is today the Betances Health Center, located at 80 Henry Street.  Paul Ramos worked tirelessly for over 30 years to promote health equity and to expand the quality of affordable health care for all in one of New York’s most diverse and underserved neighborhoods, the Lower East Side. 

As an early and active supporter of patient advocacy, he initiated local changes, which improved health care for the disadvantaged.  He developed the Betances Health Unit, a grassroots mobile health unit, into the state of the art community health care center.  This center has emerged through his vision into a proto-type for community health, one that continues its commitment to culturally respectful, compassionate care. 

In the early 1980’s, when HIV emerged, Paul’s infinite wisdom and compassion led Betances to the forefront as one of the first community health centers to begin to provide ongoing counseling, treatment and primary care to those living with HIV and AIDS.  For years, Paul was associated himself with the Lower East Side Task Force on AIDS, the Latino Commission on AIDS and the AIDS Service Center, of which he was the board chair until his untimely passing in May 2000.  His wife, four daughters and eleven grandchildren survived him.

"Carlos Alberto Martínez was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (DR). He moved to New York in 1961 and worked at a plastic factory as a mechanic and taxi driver. He endeavored to open his own car repair business and by 1977, his business had become “La Estrella Auto Part,” an automobile mechanics and body parts company. After struggling with alcohol dependency for many years, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1980, an entity he considered his lifeline. Feeling welcome at AA, he invested himself into getting well. His faith, determination, and the AA community contributed to his success in reorganizing his life. In 1984, he contributed to the founding of the “Association of Merchants and Professionals in Support of the Dominican Liberation Party.” He became close to Professor Juan Bosch, the leader of the Dominican Liberation Party and participated avidly in both the domestic political arena in DR and New York City. He supported various grassroots political candidates, earning a reputation as a distinguished member of the community. In 2002, together with a handful of people, he decided to create the Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, with the mission of helping alcoholic patients and drug addicts who needed help but were afraid to seek it because of the stigma linked to mental health and substance abuse. Don Carlos, as he was affectionately called, cared deeply about those who helped and their families. He fought to change perceptions and systems that catalogued substance abuse patients as general psychiatry patients, managing that 8 New York hospitals assigned special facilities and targeted responses to care for them. After discharge, he found appropriate homes for participants and helped them join AA, where they had access to a support system as they started their journey towards sobriety. For Carlos, the work with Alcoholics Anonymous became his life mission. He was concerned with sponsoring and giving emotional support to many substance abuse patients. Saving lives for him was a duty and a mission. Not only was he an active member, he founded several AA chapters, mentored countless members, and shared his personal testimony to help others. In addition to his work in caring for substance abuse sufferers, Carlos Martínez invested his time and resources in development programs in the DR. He served as President of the famed Dominican “Club de Leones” chapter in Manhattan. He obtained a government grant to offer free prostate cancer early detection tests for those who could not afford it and he volunteered at Lincoln Hospital, where he campaigned to educate and spread information about prostate cancer. In 1999, he created LUZ DIVINA, a magazine to disseminate information on the work carried out by the Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction. He received support from several medical professionals, businessmen and Dominican merchants. Valued and respected throughout the NY community, Don Carlos achieved that for two consecutive years the Mayor of New York City designated the month of December as the month for the Prevention of alcoholism and drug addiction.

"For the Filipino community of the greater New York City area, Little Manila is their home away from home: a dynamic portal in which members of the Filipino community maintain their connections to their loved ones both locally and internationally. The beginnings of Woodside’s Little Manila date back five decades. After the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the U.S. became open to skilled workers from around the world. In the 1970s, New York hospitals faced nursing shortages and recruited from the Philippines, bringing many Philippine nurses and their families to Queens. Those who worked at Elmhurst Hospital settled in the surrounding neighborhoods, including Woodside, where the Filipino community has since thrived. By the 1990s, 72% of Philippine immigrants in New York were registered nurses. During the early months of the COVID-19 crisis, the Filipino community was severely impacted—not only were many working in the health care system, but Little Manila was physically situated on the front line of the city’s epicenter. Presently, 54% of New York Filipinos live in Queens. In 2009, 13,000 of the 85,000 residents of Woodside are of Philippine descent, thus making up 15% of the neighborhood’s population. An estimated 86,000 Filipinos and Filipino Americans reside in NYC, making them the third-largest Asian group in New York today.

"The only Staten Islander to win the Medal of Honor during World War II. He hailed from West Brighton.  Joseph F. Merrell made a made a gallant, 1-man attack against vastly superior enemy forces near Lohe, Germany. His unit, attempting a quick conquest of hostile hill positions that would open the route to Nuremberg before the enemy could organize his defense of that city, was pinned down by brutal fire from rifles, machine pistols, and 2 heavy machineguns. Entirely on his own initiative, Pvt. Merrell began a single-handed assault. He ran 100 yards through concentrated fire, barely escaping death at each stride, and at pointblank range engaged 4 German machine pistolmen with his rifle, killing all of them while their bullets ripped his uniform. As he started forward again, his rifle was smashed by a sniper's bullet, leaving him armed only with 3 grenades. But he did not hesitate. He zigzagged 200 yards through a hail of bullets to within 10 yards of the first machinegun, where he hurled 2 grenades and then rushed the position ready to fight with his bare hands if necessary. In the emplacement he seized a Luger pistol and killed what Germans had survived the grenade blast. Rearmed, he crawled toward the second machinegun located 30 yards away, killing 4 Germans in camouflaged foxholes on the way, but himself receiving a critical wound in the abdomen. And yet he went on, staggering, bleeding, disregarding bullets which tore through the folds of his clothing and glanced off his helmet. He threw his last grenade into the machinegun nest and stumbled on to wipe out the crew. He had completed this self-appointed task when a machine pistol burst killed him instantly. In his spectacular 1-man attack Pvt. Merrell killed 6 Germans in the first machinegun emplacement, 7 in the next, and an additional 10 infantrymen who were astride his path to the weapons which would have decimated his unit had he not assumed the burden of the assault and stormed the enemy positions with utter fearlessness, intrepidity of the highest order, and a willingness to sacrifice his own life so that his comrades could go on to victory.

"Joseph Galatolo was born on May 25, 1923 in Naples, Italy.  He was a sailor during WWII, and after being captured, spent two years as a Prisoner of War in Germany.  In 1947, at the age of 24, Joseph set out for America.  Not long after his arrival, he was introduced to his lovely wife Frances.  They were wed in 1949.  Together they had three children, Jackie, Mary and Tom.  The family grew to include their spouses and six grandchildren.  Joe was a dedicated family man, and there are many that probably never saw him walking without the love of his life Frances beside him. 

Joseph worked for NYCHA from 1958, until his retirement in 1983.  Joe could always be found on his beloved 18th Avenue, where he was President of the Merchant Association, and also President of the Santa Rosalia Society, which was located on 18th Avenue and 72nd Street.  He spent many hours there planning ways to improve the community.  He was the one who arranged for the holiday lights to be put up at Christmas time.  The society office was always open to everyone.  During the Columbus Day Parade, he would be there to greet and offer hospitality to the parade goers.  Whenever there was a problem to be solved or advise to be given, everyone came to “Mr. Joe.”  His community meant everything to him.  He was a member of the Golden Flame Society of St. Rosalia Church, and worked tirelessly to raise funds for the parish. 

Joseph was also a Community Mayor, and being part of this organization made him proud.  He looked forward to the annual outings planned for the handicapped children.  Joe was a member of the Stars and Striped Democratic Club, and always participated in many fund raising events.  The list of his many achievements could go on and on, but what he will be most remembered for is the Santa Rosalia Festival.  He started this feast in 1977, and it has become an annual event.  It was an event that became known as a true part of 18th Avenue. 

Joe Galatolo was a truly remarkable man, and he is missed everyday, not only by his family, but by the community he dedicated most of his life to.

"Theofan Stilian Noli, known as Fan Noli, was an Albanian writer, scholar, diplomat, politician, historian, orator, and founder of the Orthodox Church of Albanian, who served as Prime Minister. Fan Noli is venerated by Albanians as a champion of literature, history, theology, diplomacy, journalism, music, and national unity. He played an important role in the consolidation of Albanian as the national language of Albania with numerous translations of world literature masterpieces. He also wrote extensively in English: as a scholar and author of a series of publications, religious texts, and translations. He produced a translation of the New Testament in English, The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the approved Greek text of the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Greece, published in 1961. Noli earned degrees at Harvard (1912), the New England Conservatory of Music (1938), and finally his Ph.D. from Boston University (1945). In 1912, under the leadership of Fan Noli, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America, known as Vatra (The Hearth) was created. Based in Boston, Vatra at the height of its influence had 72 branches throughout the United States. The federation has historically protected the rights of the Albanians in the United States, as well lobbying with the United States Congress about the rights of the Albanians throughout the world.  Today, Vatra Federation continues to be a vibrant home to its many branches across the nation, New York, Michigan, Florida, Massachusetts, and Canada.  Both, Vatra and its newspaper “Dielli” serve as community staple and are based in the Bronx, which is the largest Albanian Community in United States.  Fan Noli was the Chief-editor of the newspaper “Dielli” (The Sun) – which began as a publication of the Boston Albanian society “Besa-Besen” from February 1909, until July 1911. He was ordained a priest at Saint Nicholas Cathedral in New York City in 1908, establishing thereby the Albanian Church and elevating the Albanian language to ecclesiastic use. He briefly resided in Albania after the 1912 declaration of independence. After World War I, Noli led the diplomatic efforts for the reunification of Albania and received the support of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Later he pursued a diplomatic-political career in Albania, successfully leading the Albanian bid for membership in the League of Nations. Noli’s eloquence in pleading Albania’s cause won him many enthusiastic supporters among the great statesmen of the postwar era, notably President Woodrow Wilson. Largely due to Noli’s impassioned pleas, Wilson fought vigorously for the right of Albania and other small nations to determine their own futures. The London Daily Mail, noting Noli’s great skills in diplomacy, hailed as the ablest of Balkan statesmen and suggested that his colleagues in neighboring countries could learn much from him A memorandum was sent to U. S. President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing a few days before a delegation of Albanian-Americans, led by Fan Noli left for France to take part in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Copies of the memorandum were sent to the foreign ministries of the Allied Powers and their ambassadors in Washington. The aim of the text and of the delegation was to ensure the continued recognition of Albania as a sovereign state. Many of the idealized views expressed in this memorandum, can still be heard among Albanians today. In 1932, Metropolitan Theophan Noli was granted permanent resident status and he returned permanently to the U.S. He had spent eight years in Germany while he waited for this visa. After his return to the U.S.A., he withdrew from political life, and he returned to his duties as the head of the Albanian Orthodox Church in North America. Paralleling his life of service in the Orthodox Church, Noli remained active in politics. An unsurpassed multitalented figure of influence, Fan Noli has been a subject of volumes of publications and research. A Harvard alum and later dual citizen who spent most of his life in the United States, Fan Noli shined in many walks of life: literature, journalism, publications, translations, theology, religious leadership, diplomacy, politics, music and helped shape the foundations of the Albanian nation. Master of 14 languages, a distinguished Shakespearean scholar and translator as well as an accomplished historian. Blessed by the American freedom of expression, which Noli admired, he was a leader in the Albanian-American community for many decades.   ",Bronx,Intersection,1657900800000.0,Gjonaj,At the intersection of Morris Park Avenue and Tenbroeck Avenue ,Fan Noli Way ,,10461.0,8191.0,Int.

Michelle, who held three college degrees, commenced her educational career in the public and private schools of Brooklyn.  At an early age, Michelle and her family moved to Queens, where she immediately enrolled in the Queens County public school system. 

A lover of learning and an avid pursuer of academic excellence, Michelle graduated from Springfield Gardens high school a year ahead of her scheduled class.  Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John’s University where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism.  In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities.  Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John’s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper.  Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John’s University, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary. 

Michelle’s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John’s, where she earned a Masters Degree in Early Childhood Education.  While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton’s Day Care center.  There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children.  Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law.  In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney’s Office, under former United States Attorney Rudolph Guiliani. 

After graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County.  While working in the D.A.’s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond.

Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community.  While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law.  Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard.  Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading. 

Michelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing.  In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so.  A politically enlightened young woman, Michelle served on the committee to elect David Dinkins and also wrote several educational books for young children, which are waiting to be published.  A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College fund. 

In 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer.  Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community.  Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer.  She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research. 

On July 10 1997, Michelle’s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end.  Her parents, her husband, and three sisters, Dietra Middleton, Elissa Middleton Thompson and Cathy Middleton Lewis, Esq, survived her.

"Angelo Campanella served in the United States Army for 2 years during WWII.  He later became a celebrated ice cream vendor and a mainstay of the Bensonhurst community and served generations of Brooklynites over the course of 50 years.  He served as the eyes and ears of the community by alerting the authorities if he ever saw a dangerous situation developing or any threat to his community, helping avert crimes before they took place.  He also warned children about drug use and offered advice to stay away from delinquent behavior.  This commitment to helping others was evident one afternoon when he saved a customer’s baby from choking to death, rushing the distraught young mother and child to the hospital just in time to save the child’s life.  He once pulled a mother and baby out from a flipped car that was in danger of catching fire and also intervened in an attempted hit-and-run by a drunk driver when a customer was hit shortly after purchasing ice cream.  He witnessed the crime and blocked the roadway with his ice cream truck, ensuring that the drunk driver could not flee the scene and was apprehended by police officers.  His service has been documented in a number of publications including The New York Times, The New York Daily News and People Magazine.  He began his business in 1944 growing his business from a freezer mounted on a bicycle, to a Ford Model A, a Model T and eventually a 1971 Chevrolet ice cream truck.

"Ciro Pappalardo born in Tre Case, Naples.  When he was 9 years old, he emigrated to Staten Island to join his brothers who had established Joe and Pats Pizzeria, which would become one of New York’s most famous pizzerias. He immediately began working in the restaurant upon arrival. Work was synonymous with family, as the business was owned by his older brothers; his sisters were waitresses, and his father made the sauce.  Hard work, love and family were all one in the same for the young man. These seminal experiences in the restaurant proved to be cornerstones for his life view, character and aspirations. Having spent his life mastering the nuance of making the perfect pizza pie in Joe and Pats, Ciro opened Ciro Pizza Cafe in 1997 in Huguenot. An immediate success, the local community embraced the food and unmistakable warm family atmosphere that Ciro created. He was a pillar of the community, a man who would take the time to serve his community in business and service. He served as a member of the 120th Precinct Community Council for many years, donated to multiple charities yearly and during the pandemic, helped to feed first responders and nurses with food donations. He also helped to support families who were stricken with Covid-19 and unable to leave their homes by sending free food on an almost daily schedule in some cases. Most importantly, Ciro was an inspiration to the youth of the community he served. He gave many teens from the local high schools their first job. He taught them the importance of hard work, dedication, and still having a good laugh. He inspired many young men and women to become small business owners, showing them the importance of serving their community and how rewarding it could be not only financially, but emotionally. After his passing, former employees expressed how they continue to see Ciro as a mentor. A simple lesson about wiping up a table after a difficult customer would later translate to a lesson in humanity and understanding. These lessons would be carried through to their professional lives and eventually down to their own young and beginning families.

"Stanley Jay was a former college professor in the Performing and Creative Arts Department at Staten Island Community College.  He was co-founder, along with Harold “Hap” Kuffner of Randall Manor, of Mandolin Brothers which became a supplier of fine instruments to such famous musicians as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Jimmy Buffett, Judy Collins, The Edge (U2), and Paul Simon.  Mandolin Brothers opened in 1971 and is known world-wide and brought George Harrison to Staten Island to buy a pre-war National ukulele, and also Paul McCartney had his famous Hofner Violin Bass, the primary instrument he used with The Beatles, repaired there and later said in an interview in Bass Player Magazine “My bass never played in tune but I brought it to Mandolin Brothers and they set it straight.” In 1976 singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell made a double purchase at the retail institution and was inspired, on her way back to the City on the Staten Island Ferry to write a song that begins with the line “I went to Staten Island, Sharon, to buy myself a mandolin.” This mention in an introspective, auto-biographical song put Mandolin Brothers on the map.  It appears on Ms. Mitchell’s album Hejira (1976) and again in a retrospective album titled Songs of a Prairie Girl.  He served a three year term on the Board of Directors of the Staten Island Council of the Arts in the 1970s and was a strong supporter of the Arts on Staten Island.  In 1980, he and Harold “Hap” Kuffner met Ned Steinberger and, along with the designer-inventor and reinforced plastics pioneer Robert Young of Mamaroneck, created Steinberger Sound Corp., makers of a revolutionary, all-graphite composite bass and guitar that became one of the most famous recording industry instruments of that decade. Demand for the original product was strong and today those solid body electric instruments are collectibles whose market value continues to increase. The Steinberger Bass won 5 industrial design awards including “Best Of” in Time Magazine in 1981.  Jay was featured on radio and television programs on all three major networks, NPR, the BBC and History Detectives, and quoted in articles in such magazines as Forbes, The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Mandolin Brothers was named “Best Guitar Shop in New York” by both New York Magazine and The Village Voice. In March 2014 the firm was honored by a feature article in Guitar Aficionado Magazine.

"Joseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. “One night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,” Magnus recalled. “Thank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.” Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. “I was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,” Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps’ services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.  ",Queens,Intersection,1657900800000.0,Holden,At the intersection of 75th Street and 58th Avenue ,Joseph Magnus Way ,,11379.0,8294.0,Int.

"Alvin Benjamin was both a dreamer and visionary. As a true visionary, his early commitment to, and success with, affordable multifamily and senior housing proved that the two beliefs could be complementary business objectives. In his later years, his vision of community transformation through smart-growth development translated into the ground-breaking Arverne by The Sea Urban Redevelopment project, one of the largest Urban Redevelopments in the Country. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and Brooklyn College before voluntarily enlisting in the United States Navy during World War II. He rose to the rank of captain and was awarded the Bronze Star for his actions aboard a landing vessel during the battle of Iwo Jima. Upon his return from war, he enrolled in law school and took a position as a mortgage broker with the Lefrak Organization, under the tutelage of the legendary Sam Lefrak. He founded Benjamin Development in the early 1960's. His imprint was initially in New York and focused on affordable senior housing – a niche he saw as not being adequately served. His company expanded throughout the East Coast. His development portfolio similarly expanded to include affordable multifamily units, luxury multifamily units, commercial properties, and smart-growth communities incorporating residential, commercial and retail. He was resolute in his commitment to community and his responsibility to the environment. He was proud that the hallmark of his projects – what he would become known for as a developer – was building in harmony with the environment and fulfilling the needs of the local community. “A developer must respect nature’s gifts and build to complement what she has given,” Alvin was often quoted saying.

Casella brought to this parish a wonderful love of God and a tremendous desire to help all in need, Catholic or not.  He was a wonderful example of how to live the gospel and spread the Good News to all, regardless of religion, race or origin. 

Fr. Casella was instrumental in helping to develop and get funding for many youth programs, based from the parish school and throughout the neighborhood.  He helped to identify summer job opportunities for over 200 young people in 1996 and 1997.  He also sponsored a very active Scouting program serving over 150 young men and 75 young women and their families. 

Fr. Casella also served on the boards of St. Barnabas hospital and the Fordham-Tremont Community Mental Health Center.  He was able to use his position with these organizations to help many people.  His position at St. Barnabas, for example, allowed him to help a 6-month-old child fly from the Dominican Republic for delicate heart surgery.  

Father David Casella passed away on February 7, 1999 from a heart attack at 49 years old.  His short life positively impacted many other lives.  He achieved the goal of any simple parish priest by bringing many people to God; he was truly blessed and he blessed the communities and parishes he touched.

"Lawrence Virgilio. The following biographical information was printed in Dennis Duggan’s New York Newsday column (“Recall Names, Forget Numbers”) of September 21, 2001.  It is reproduced here in its entirety both for the information provided and its poignancy. 

“Lawrence Joseph Virgilio was born to be a firefighter. 

 

            He was tough when he had to be, and tender when he needed to be. He grew up in Woodside, the kind of small, neighborly community Thornton Wilder portrayed in his play ""Our Town."" The difference was that Woodside is parted in the middle by the rumbling No. 7 elevated subway train. 

 

            Someone asked Virgilio's mother, Lucy, about his first name. ""We named him Lawrence after the movie, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which had just come out,"" she said. 

 

            Fire Capt. Dan Tracy, who worked with Virgilio, said the 38-year-old firefighter was ""unwavering,"" and that he had a side job as a physical therapist. 

 

            ""One of his patients was a famous wrestler - he was known as the Masked Marvel - who had cancer and was living in squalor on the Lower East Side,"" Tracy said. ""Larry grew to like him and took care of him as he was dying, buying him things like a refrigerator and a couch."" 

 

            Tracy - choked with emotion - told the story of the caring firefighter at his funeral yesterday. He got the packed house at St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church in Woodside laughing when he told of how nothing fazed Virgilio, who was trapped when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center collapsed last week. 

 

            ""We were sitting in the kitchen in the firehouse,"" he said, ""and I asked him to              make some tea. He got the kettle, filled it with water, put it on the stove and lit it. 

 

            ""The kettle went sky high because we had taped firecrackers to the bottom of it.                    Larry didn't say a word. He was unflappable."" 

 

            Virgilio is one of more than 300 firefighters who are missing and presumed dead,                    a number so obscene that Tracy vowed ""we will never talk about their deaths using numbers. Their names will always be told."" 

 

            Virgilio was one of three firefighters from star-crossed Squad 18 who were buried                    yesterday. The others were firefighters Eric Allen and Manuel Mojica. 

 

            Squad 18 on West 10th Street in the West Village was famous - before Sept. 11                    - for bearing the brunt of the biggest single loss of firefighters in the department's                    history, in 1966. That year, five out of 12 men who died at the Wonder drugstore fire on East 23rd were from Squad 18. 

 

            But fire is unforgiving and has no memory and so it was left to the mourners, the  priest, the bagpipers and Virgilio's family to conjure up his memory. 

 

            ""He was a Woodside kid,"" Msgr. Joseph Finnerty said. ""And he still lives here over on 59th Street."" 

 

            Finnerty was standing in the vestibule of the church yesterday where the bells tolled, the subway rumbled and a church organ played a hymn. All of this under a steady drizzle. 

 

           ""He was baptized here, he made his first Holy Communion here. And he was                   confirmed here,"" Finnerty said, herding a crew of five altar helpers, two of them girls, telling them, ""when you hear the bagpipers, that means he's here."" 

 

           They brought Virgilio up Roosevelt Avenue to 58th Street, the way they bring all                    firefighters to their church - on top of a fire engine from his own company and draped in purple. 

 

           It was unbearably sad and worse when the choir sang a song that is sung at                    almost all the firefighter funerals. It is called ""Be Not Afraid"" and it includes these                    lyrics: 

 

                   If you walk amid the burning flame, you shall not be burned. 

 

          Virgilio did walk among the flames because, like his brothers, he was trained to                    go in when most people are going out. It's why firefighting isn't a job, it is a mission. 

 

          No one has suffered more than the firefighters and their families, who now must                    take them to their graves during the coming days and weeks, the way they took Virgilio to Calvary Cemetery a few blocks from his church yesterday. 

 

          Woodside has been shattered by what happened in downtown Manhattan,   Finnerty said. 

 

          ""A lot of people from the parish are missing. This place is dealing with                    unbearable sadness,"" he said. 

 

          At the end of Mass, as eight firefighters carried Virgilio out of the church, a        policeman named Edward Harrigan played ""Taps."" It was the loneliest sound on a gray lonely day.” ",Queens,Intersection,998496000000.0,"McCaffrey, Sabini and O’Donovan ", existing playground located at 52nd Street and 39th Drive in Windmuller Park,Lawrence Virgilio Playground,,11377.0,8332.0,Int.

"James Cooney is best known for his prominent role in the swimming and diving community on the Staten Island. Most notably, he was the Swimming and Diving Coach of Great Kills Swim Club from 1980 to 2011. Over his 31 years at GKSC, he made an impact on over 3,000 athletes. He was also the diving coach at the college of Staten Island from 2010 to 2016 while also running a youth Diving program out of the college at the same time. Great Kills Swim Club was by no means a powerhouse in the Staten Island Interclub league, but he had a way of making it feel like it did. Every practice, race, meet and most importantly, child, mattered. When he was coach, each and every child on the team was proud to be a part of it. He had a way of remembering every child and having a fun nickname for them. He never missed a race or a dive. In fact, before a race, you could always hear him shouting from the sidelines and during your race you could find him pacing the sides of the pool. After a dive, you could look to him for a subtle nod of approval that would motivate you through the rest of your list. There is no doubt that his 31-year reign as coach has a lasting legacy at the GKSC. Every coach that has worked with him or after him has channeled his energy and motivation. His presence is still very much alive at Great Kills Swim Club and in Staten Island Interclub. In 2020, an award was started in his name called The Jim Cooney Memorial Award, which is given to a swimmer or diver from one of the five Staten Island Interclubs, that has a true passion for the sport. The recipient is someone who will continue to participate in the sport as either an athlete, coach or volunteer. He introduced so many children to the sport of Swimming and Diving and it made an impact on so many people. There are countless numbers of collegiate athletes that credit him with motivating them to continue swimming and diving through the years.

"Dr. Williams was named Bronx Community College’s (BCC) fourth president, the first woman to hold the office. Her legacy of student success has been woven into the very fabric of our institution. She was the guiding force behind $150 million in capital construction, including the building of North Hall and Library and the Children’s Center, as well as the renovation of the Roscoe Brown Student Center. These projects were mere dreams for many years before President Williams turned them into reality. Her steadfast leadership led to BCC’s student body growing to over 10,000 during her tenure and our diverse faculty increasing by more than 90 full-time educators. She was responsible for the College’s first general education program and first Strategic Plan. Campus centers devoted to student success like the Writing Center, the Math Lab and the Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology were also established during her tenure. Her 15-year tenure was marked by the rapid expansion of BCC’s international presence, including partnerships with schools in Africa. In her own words, that initiative was “not just study abroad and the influx of international students, but the curriculum and the whole climate of the college. We were able to bring global issues into our community.” At the national level, Dr. Williams was actively involved with the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and served as the Chairperson in 2000. She also was actively involved in the National Council on Black American Affairs (NCBAA), a council of the AACC. Her work with NCBAA involved the development and mentoring of African American future leaders. To accomplish this goal, the Carolyn Grubbs Williams Leadership Development Institute was established in her honor. The Institute prepares African Americans in community colleges for leadership roles to insure that the pipeline to executive-level positions is fluid. President Williams will always be remembered for her passionate commitment to the students of Bronx Community College. “The students’ success is our success,” she was fond of saying. It is a guiding philosophy of BCC to this day.  ",Brooklyn,Intersection,1657900800000.0,Cabrera,At the intersection of Hall of Fame Terrace and University Avenue ,Dr. Carolyn G.

"Jose Pena Gomez was a three-time candidate for President of the Dominican Republic, the leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party and former Mayor of Santo Domingo. He was born in Valverde to parents of Haitian descent and was orphaned as an infant when Rafael Trujillo, the military dictator of the Dominican Republic, ordered a massacre in which more than 10,000 Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent in the border area were killed and additional thousands fled across the border. He was raised by a peasant family and gave him their name. When he was 15, he became an instructor in a literacy program for poor children in his native province and later worked as a teacher in rural and night schools. He also studied political science at universities in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, and became the press secretary of the leftist Dominican Revolutionary Party, and later its secretary-general. The Dominican Revolutionary Party’s leader was Juan Bosch who led the opposition to the Trujillo dictatorship. When Bosch was elected president in 1962, Jose Pena Gomez had emerged as a protege. Juan Bosch was ousted by a coup in 1963 which led to a civil war and an American invasion of the Dominican Republic. Pena Gomez eventually had to leave the country and took refuge in France to study political science and constitutional and labor law for two years at the University of Paris. He also studied political science in courses at Harvard University and Michigan State University. While in exile, he was involved in efforts to obtain international condemnation of human rights violations in the Dominican Republic. In 1982, he was elected mayor of Santo Domingo.
