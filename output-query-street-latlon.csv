"Marshall C. England was born on October 27, 1932, in Thomasville, Alabama, to Reverend L.T. England, Sr. and Mrs. Daisy Bronx England. He grew up in Alabama and graduated from Alabama A&M University. After serving a hitch in the United States Army, Mr. England went onto teach for 3 years at Linden Academy High School, in Linden, Alabama, where he also coached football. 

In 1958, Mr. England moved to New York City and began work as a street gang worker for the New  York City Youth Board. He went on to work with numerous community organizations until, during the anti-poverty movement, he founded and became Executive Director of L.A.B.O.R.

L.A.B.O.R. was an umbrella agency which included the operation of two day care centers, a housing program, a major food distribution program, a youth program, a Big Brother/Big Sister program and a community residence program for formerly mentally institutionalized patients. 

Mr. England was a man whose enormous commitment to issues and causes made him a tireless worker. Living on a limited income, he continuously worked for positive change by informing and involving people. He also believed in starting and building new organizations to meet community needs by addressing a myriad of issues that impacted on poor neighborhoods and communities of color. In his early years in New York, he chaired New York C.O.R.E. and the board of the HARYOU-ACT Community Corporation. Mr. England received numerous awards for his community activism including the “Community Leadership Award” from the Bronx Branch of the New York Urban League (1983), the “Man of the Year Award” from The Bronx Unity Democratic Club (1982) and the Health Advocacy Award” from the Health Policy Advisory Center (1990).

"Charles “Chuck” Seidner was an old fashioned type of guy, honest, hard working, dedicated and a good family man. Born on October 22, 1942, he later resided in the Bronx attending his neighborhood schools. Later on, he faithfully managed Loeser’s Delicatessen for 32 years and lived in the Kingsbridge community for most of his 58 years. Chuck was the Deli man with a difference. Referred to as “ the Mayor of 231st Street”, he was someone that deli customers, store merchants, deliverymen, and passerby’s came to know and trust.  

He wasn’t just working, to him, what he did was not just a “job” because he brought happiness, a simplicity and goodness of feelings into other people’s lives. This fulfilled him as much as others. Chuck’s life was very meaningful to all of the people who had some contact with him. He passed away on August 19, 2001.

"Edmond J.  Safra was born in Beirut, Lebanon, the third of the eight children of Esther and Jacob Safra.  Jacob Safra was the proprietor of Banque de Credit National, successor to the business of Safra Freres, a merchant banking business that originated about 1840 in the Ottoman Empire. 

In 1948 Edmond was sent, along with an experienced banker, to Italy to consider diversification opportunities for the family.  The post war atmosphere was filled with opportunities for an energetic, entrepreneurial banker and Edmond created a precious metals trading business, the first of what was to become a long string of financial and banking successes. 

In 1952 Edmond was encouraged by his father to explore opportunities in the New World.  Having visited North and South America he decided to open a business in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Within a few years progress was so substantial that Edmund persuaded his father to move the rest of the family to Brazil.  The Brazilian business evolved into Banco Safra, which is now Brazil's fifth largest bank.  Today, Edmond’s two younger brothers privately own it. 

In 1956 Edmond opened the predecessor to Trade Development Bank in Geneva, Switzerland.  He wanted to meet the international financial and banking needs of middle eastern families which, like his own were moving from that troubled region. In 1983 Trade Development Bank was sold to the American Express Company for $550 million. 

In the early 1960's Edmond decided to complete the South American European banking triangle and applied for a national banking charter in New York City.  The charter was granted and Republic National Bank of New York was opened in January, 1996.  Its initial capital, which was slightly more than $10 million, was at the time the largest initial capitalization of a new bank in the history of the United States.  The ribbon was cut by Robert Kennedy.  Edmond never forgot that Robert Kennedy helped him, and after Bobby's tragic death Edmond created The Robert F. Kennedy Chair in Latin American Studies at Harvard University. 

Republic became one of America's most successful banks.  Through merchandise promotions and acquisitions, it became a leading retail bank with more than one million accounts, while simultaneously developing the world's leading gold trading business.  In 1999, Republic and its European affiliate, Safra Republic Holdings, SA, were sold to HSBC, PLC for approximately $10 billion. 

Shortly before his tragic death in 1999, Mr. Safra formed the Edmund J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, to carry forward his philanthropic mission.  His foundation, with the guidance and support of his wife, Lily, has honored his memory in many ways: by creating The Edmond J. Safra Hall at The Museum of Jewish Heritage; The Edmond J.  Safra campus of Hebrew University in Israel; The Edmond J.  Safra Fountain Court at Somerset House in London; The Edmond J.  Safra Synagogue in St.  Petersburg, Russia; and The Edmond J.

"Bishop Roberts, Sr. immigrated to the United States and settled in Harlem, New York, where he worked as an elevator operator in a commercial building. He became a member of the Holy Cross Cathedral Orthodox Church and at night pursued a degree in theological studies. He later became a postulant in the Endich Theological Seminary under the tutelage of his Eminence Georg Alexander McGuire. Upon completion of his theological training, he was admitted to the Holy Orders as a Bishop. Bishop Roberts was drawn to organizations that advocated for black self-determination and racial equality and joined the Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The first branch of the UNIA in the U.S. was founded in New York in 1917, with the aims of repatriation, promoting racial pride, and the need to develop more independent African states. Bishop Roberts was committed to the spiritual well-being of his Harlem community, which included Caribbean immigrants and African- American migrants from the southern states. Inspired to establish a community-based church, St. Thomas Liberal Catholic Church was established on December 21, 1926 in the village of Harlem. Under the leadership of Bishop James P. Roberts, Sr., the church grew quickly and had to be relocated several times to accommodate its growth. Ultimately, a permanent structure was purchased at 147 West 144th Street in Harlem. Bishop Roberts was truly a spiritual pioneer in Harlem. Today, his son James P. Roberts Jr., serves as the church's bishop. In 1934, Bishop Roberts established The Antigua Progressive Society to provide charitable assistance to his beloved Harlem community and the island of Antigua. The objective was to ""foster friendship, promote and cultivate social, economic, and intellectual intercourse among its members, along with supporters to render aid in time of need, sickness, or death."" The Society was incorporated in 1935 in New York State with an overarching mission to be ""a beacon of light to all."" The Antigua Progressive Society later merged with another organization and renamed themselves the Antigua and Barbuda Progressive Society (ABPS). In 1964, the ABPS purchased a building located at 12 West 122nd Street in the village of Harlem which became its headquarters. That building is fondly referred to as the ""Antigua and Barbuda House."" ABPS continues to operate from this building eighty-five years after its founding in one of Harlem's Historical districts at 122nd Street and Lenox Avenue. Today, the Antigua and Barbuda Progressive Society, Inc. is a 50l(c) (3) organization exclusively supporting charitable, religious and educational purposes. In 2012, the society donated the first 50 years of its records to the Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books Division at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The following year, a public exhibit at the Schomburg Center titled ""A Lighthouse in New York,"" show cased the records and accomplishments of ABPS. The ABPS continues the legacy of Bishop James P, Roberts, Sr., by actively engaging in the Harlem community. Among the activities, ABPS has adopted the Drew Family Day Care Center in Harlem where our annual ""Holiday Toy Drive"" brings joy to the children and the families of the center. ABPS also supported the Shades of Truth Theater. We have partnered with the local churches such as: Ephesus Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Greater Calvary Baptist Church and the Beulah Wesleyan Methodist Church. We also support women's homeless shelter, organize local book drives for children to promote literacy, serve Thanksgiving Dinner, as well as provide ""take out"" dinners at our headquarters. In our homeland of Antigua & Barbuda, we host an annual blood drive at Mount Saint John Medical Centre in Antigua. The APBS has a strong connection with the local Harlem community and actively helps to foster transnational connections with communities back in Antigua. More importantly, the society has been able to successfully engage younger members and encourage their participation within the society, which has ultimately led to the growth of its membership.",Manhattan,Street,1657987200000.0,Perkins,Between Malcolm X Boulevard and Mount Morris Park West ,"Bishop James P.

"The following biography was provided by “Spectrum: Home and School Magazine.” 

Harriet Tubman was born Harriet Ross in Dorchester County, Maryland in 1820. Her parents were from the Ashanti tribe of West Africa, and they worked as slaves on the Brodas plantation. In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5.  
Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts.  

In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman's cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister.  
 

Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason-Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet's trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister's family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York.  

By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the ""Moses of her people"" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves.  

With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled “Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman”, published in 1869 were a great financial help.  

In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died of pneumonia. She was 93 years old.  

Harriet Tubman was not afraid to fight for the rights of African-Americans. Her story is one of dedication and inspiration. During her lifetime Harriet was honored by many people. In 1897, her bravery even inspired Queen Victoria to award her a silver medal.

"The following biographical information was provided by the Hinton family and the New York Times. 

Milton “Milt” Hinton was born on June 23, 1910 in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Mr. Hintons’s parents separated when he was an infant and his mother moved to Chicago where he joined her, after living with relatives, when he was nine years old. With his mother’s encouragement he began studying the violin. In 1929, Mr. Hinton taught himself to play the string bass because opportunities for violinists were limited, as symphony orchestras were not yet hospitable to Black musicians. 

After working for several years with a Jazz band in the Chicago area, Mr. Hinton was hired by the Cab Calloway Band in 1936.With the Calloway band, he became one of the first Jazz bassists to be featured on records as a soloist. During his 60 year career, Mr. Hinton, nicknamed the “The Judge”, performed and recorded with many legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Louis Armsrong, Benny Goodman, Erskine Tate, Art Tatum, Jabbo Smith, Eddie South, Zutty Singleton, Cab Calloway, Eubie Blake, John Coltrane, Quincy Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Paul McCartney, Andre Kostelanetz, Guy Lombardo, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Billy Holiday, and Barbara Streisand. He became one of the most recorded artists in history as estimates of the records and albums he recorded range from 600 to well over 1,000. 

At the height of his popularity Milt Hinton entertained Presidents and dignitaries at the White House, served as chairman of the International Society of Bassists, The National Association of Jazz Educators, the Jazz Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and held charter memberships in the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University and the Newport Jazz Festival Hall of Fame. He received many honors during his lifetime including honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Hamilton College, Skidmore College, Trinity College and William Patterson College of the State of New Jersey. Mr. Hinton also received awards from Esquire and Downbeat Magazines, “The Satchmo Award” from the Saratoga Jazz Society, “The Benny Carter Award” from the American Federation of Jazz Societies, “The Living Treasure Award” from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and the “Keys to the City” of more than a dozen cities. 

Milt “The Judge” Hinton died on December 19, 2000 in Queens where he had been a pillar of the St. Albans community for many years. He was survived by his wife Mona; a daughter, Charlotte Morgan; and a granddaughter. Because of his outstanding contributions to the Jazz music of the Twentieth Century, and his lasting inspiration to his community, it is fitting that 113th Avenue, between Marne Place and 175th Street in St. Albans, where he lived for more than a quarter of a century be named “Milt Hinton Place” to honor this musical legend.

"The Tuskegee Airmen were African American pilots who fought in World War II and were the first African American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces.  Formally, they formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Corps.  In spring 1944, the 332nd Fighter Group were sent overseas with the 100th, 301st and 302nd fighter squadrons.  The 332nd Fighter Group escorted the Fifteenth Air Force heavy strategic bombing raids into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Germany.  These assignments marked the first aerial combat missions ever carried out by African American pilots.   In total, 996 pilots were trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Tuskegee, Alabama, from 1941 to 1946 with approximately 445 men deployed overseas. The Tuskegee Airmen had an impressive combat record earning the name Red Tails or Red-Tail Angels because of the distinctive red paint predominately applied on the tail section of their aircrafts.  150 Tuskegee Airmen lost their lives in accidents or combat including 66 pilots killed in action or accidents and 32 fallen into captivity as prisoners of war.   The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 15,533 combat sorties and 1578 missions flown.  The 332nd Fighter Group shot down 112 enemy aircraft in the air, destroyed over 600 railcars, trucks, and other motor vehicles, sunk one destroyer and 40 boats by P-47 machine gun fire and had a nearly perfect record of not losing United States bombers. The Tuskegee Airmen received numerous awards and decorations for valor and performance including the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. The Tuskegee Airmen have been recognized for helping spur the desegregation of the United States Military and their contributions during the civil rights movement.  Surviving members of the 332nd Fighter Group still take part in educating and inspiring youth at the Queens Library Center in Jamaica and at York College.  In 2007, as part of the College Now summer program, which taught approximately 80 students subjects including Astronomy, Fine Arts, Music, Aviation and Psychology, nine Tuskegee Airmen were present at the award ceremony to encourage and inspire the program’s participants. In 2009, York College opened an exhibition dedicated to the Tuskegee Airmen in the school’s Performing Arts Center consisting of photographs, a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to the Airmen in 2007, a replica of the P-51 Mustang with its distinctive “Red Tail,” and a life-sized statue of a Tuskegee Airmen.

"New York City Councilman James E. Davis dedicated his life to stopping violence in urban America, particularly violence in urban communities in New York City. Councilman James E. Davis was born in 1962, graduated from Samuel Tilden High School in 1980 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Pace University in 1989.  Upon graduation, James Davis joined the New York City Corrections Department, serving for two years at Riker’s Island before joining the New York City Transit Department as a police officer.  In 1993 he was transferred to the New York City Police Department and upon graduation was assigned to the 73rd Precinct in his home borough of Brooklyn, later teaching social science as a certified New York State instructor at the New York City Police Academy and a Youth Officer at the 69th Precinct in Canarsie, Brooklyn.   

Prior to elected office, he made many strides to combat negative influences on children in his community including his successful crusade against the largest toy manufacturer, Toys R Us, where he persuaded the company to stop selling toy guns that appeared real or could be modified to look like a real weapon; and campaigned against MTV’s daytime and evening music format, calling on the cable music station to stop showing videos during the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. that glorify violence. Since his campaign, MTV has publicly announced that they have made positive changes regarding the broadcast of music videos.  

Because he was so committed to making a difference in the lives of urban youth, Councilman James E. Davis founded a voluntary, not-for-profit organization called “Love Yourself” Stop the Violence, dedicated to instilling the message of self-love, self-respect, respect for our communities and partnership between communities and police departments across America.  The Stop the Violence events are attended by thousands of community residents and feature prominent and notable guests including three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the world, Evander Holyfield; recording superstars Salt-N-Pepa and many more.  James Davis sought political office to put himself in a position to allocate resources to benefit the community. 

In recognition of his hard work and dedication, James Davis was featured in several local and national newspapers including The New York Daily News, The New York Post, The New York Times and The Washington Post; as well as national cable network programs such as USA Live, The Maury Povich Show, Leeza and The Montell Williams Show, and offered his insightful wisdom on law enforcement and its effects on the relationship between communities and police departments on such programs as CNBC, CNN, BET and MSNBC.  In 1995 Council Member James E. Davis was honored as one of today’s heroes who exemplify the spirit and dedication of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by CBS television.

A gurdwara is a place of assembly and worship for Sikhs. People from all faiths, and those who do not profess any faith, are welcomed in Sikh gurdwaras. From 1972 the Richmond Hill gurdwara founded by the Sikh Cultural Society of New York welcomed Sikhs from the entire New York metropolitan area travelled there to attend religious services. The gurdwara offered meals, lodging and other services to visitors and to the continuing stream of Sikh immigrants. It served as a house of worship, community center and entry point to a new country. As increasing numbers of Sikh immigrants arrived in America the gurdwara continued to be the central focus for this community.

"James Russo was born in Rosebank, Staten Island on September 18, 1915, to Vito and Theresa Russo.  He lived in that community all of his life.  In 1937, Mr.  Russo's father, and 46 other members of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Society, built a shrine honoring “Our Lady of Mount Carmel.” The Shrine, called “Our Lady of Mount Carmel Grotto,” was built on Amity Street around the corner from Mount Carmel Hall, the society's headquarters.  Vito Russo maintained the shrine on a daily basis until his death in 1955. 

After his father's death in 1955, James Russo took on the responsibility for maintaining the grotto.  At least once a day he would walk from his home to inspect the structure and replace any missing stones or shells.  He felt his biggest responsibility was to preserve the shrine and the role that it played in the annual “Feast of Mount Carmel” celebrations.  This was his legacy for future generations of Staten Islanders. 

James Russo served with the United States Navy during World War II and took part in the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944.  After the war Mr.  Russo returned to Staten Island and married Nancy Carrucci Russo.  The couple had three children, a daughter, Bernice and two sons, Vito and John.  In addition to their own family, the Russo's helped dozens of foster children, over a 40-year period, until they could be returned to their families or placed in permanent adoptive homes.  In the process, the Russo's themselves adopted five children.  Mr.  Russo supported his family by working for 30 years as a maintenance worker at Seaview Hospital and Home, retiring in 1978.

"For the past seven decades the game of Stickball has been an important team sport throughout many cities in the United States but especially in New York City. Here poor and working class people in various neighborhoods have played the game and in the process strengthened their personal relationships and maintained strong community bonds. 

Of all the games that rose from the streets of urban America, none carried more mystique and legend than the game of Stickball adopted from and closely linked to baseball, Stickball has transformed the urban landscape into a dramatic stage where great competitions are played, remembered and retold and never forgotten. No game could be more local or indigenous to the ""Barrio""s of America. The streets of urban America are the ball fields. The manhole covers, cars and the lamp posts are recast into bases. The neighborhood itself has become the Stadium and the residents and neighbors are the fans, adding commentary from the building stoops that functioned as field level seats and or from the windows and fire escapes that comprised the upper decks. 

In particular, one group the 111th street Oldtimers, organized in 1968, used Stickball as their means to improve and reach out to young and old alike, to stay involved and make their neighborhoods a better place to live. As players they met and spoke of working together to help their community do things for themselves and become self-sufficient. They organized and raised money to send under-privileged youth to summer camp, assisted in the formation of the Tito Puente Scholarship Fund and distributed toys to children in pediatric wards on Christmas and on Three Kings Day. They also sponsored the Medical Career Explorers Program and hosted an Annual Stickball Family Day Reunion, which is still attended by thousands annually. 

Three years ago, members of this original group joined together with other Stickball aficionados and embarked on creating the Stickball Hall of Fame.

"Betty Myrl Victoria Davis was the youngest of eleven siblings, six girls and five boys, born to George and Irene Davis on August 2, 1938. She grew up in her birthplace of Mavis Bank, Kingston, Jamaica never knowing her father who died when she was only two years old. She completed Elementary and High School in Whitfield Town, Kingston, learning sewing and embroidery, which she adopted as an occupation throughout the early years of her life. 

Betty joined the Jamaica Omnibus Service (JOS) in 1970, the country’s state-run bus transportation system at that time. She served for thirteen years as a conductress before she immigrated to the United States in April 1983. Betty had compassion for children, the sick and the elderly and thus naturally found joy in being a Home Health Aide, placing emotional satisfaction over material compensation. In September 1990, Betty’s love for children led to an opportunity of being a School Crossing Guard with the New York City Police Department. She braved snow, sleet and rain but always enjoyed the sunshine in reporting to work to protect her children, daily, from the hazards of the road. Her last assigned post was Sacred Heart School where there was mutual enjoyment between her and her children who craved her frequent gifts and loving encouragements on their way in to school. 

Betty worshiped at, and became a member of Hollis Avenue Congregational Church in 1984. She taught the younger children in Sunday School, was a member of the Church council and president of the Chancel Choir. In these ministries, Betty had an opportunity to display some of her God-given talents of writing and singing spiritual songs. Writing poetry was another of her pastimes and she inspired many hearts with her kind eloquence. 

Betty was survived by six children, Beverly, Clive, Juliet, Adonis, Renaldo and Georgia; nine brothers and sisters, Dennis, Earnest, Isabelle, Eric, Cecil, Eunice, Olive Laura and Rose; twelve grandchildren, Tamieka, Donniel, Andrew, Lamoy, Jermaine, Ronaldo, Nicole, Tannise, Akiem, Kamaal, Tiphanie and Travis; two great-grandchildren, Brianna and Stephen; and a host of nieces, nephews cousins and other relatives.

"Ben Edwards was one of the hardest working, committed, and productive public servants of Brooklyn. He was the long-serving president of the Lefferts Manor Association (LMA). He led an organization whose core mission was to uphold and defend the one-family-only housing covenant over the homes that comprise the Lefferts Manor Historic District, a subset of Prospect Lefferts Gardens (PLG). The group also orchestrates the popular Prospect Lefferts Gardens House and Garden Tour. The LMA also publishes the Echo. He had the longest tenure of any LMA president since the group’s founding a century ago. He persuaded the Landmarks Preservation Commission to issue advice instead of fines when several homeowners in recent years ran afoul of the historic district’s exterior rehab codes, especially as it related to window replacement. Working with then Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, funds were found for all of PLG to receive wrought-iron tree guards throughout the neighborhood. He managed to get the city to live up to a promise it made years earlier with the installation of the historic Bishop’s Crook lampposts that line the Manor’s blocks. He helped bring landmark status to the stately limestone block on Ocean Avenue near Lincoln Road. Beyond his long presidency of the LMA, he served nearly ten years as a board member and most recently treasurer on CB, and he was a longstanding member of the Police Community Council. He did all that and more while working as an associate broker at a Century franchise, earning the real estate chain’s “21st Century Achiever” honor. He was a bulwark against predatory development and spent a lot of time challenging the ambitions of realtors and developers who set their targets on PLG. ",Brooklyn,Street,1657900800000.0,Eugene,Between Flatbush Avenue and Bedford Avenue ,Ebenezer “Ben” Edwards Way ,Maple Street ,11225.0,1351.0,Int.

"Marie Davis was a parent, teacher and activist leader in the Hunts Point community for nearly four decades. Mrs. Davis moved to 750 Faile Street in 1977, and raised her eight children there. Soon after moving to the area, Mrs. Davis began working at P.S. 48 where she touched the lives of thousands of students through her steadfast belief that every child, no matter their race, economic background or zip code, receive the best education and support possible. Mrs. Davis’ unwavering advocacy on behalf of the children she taught went hand-in-hand with her beliefs that her students should also have access to clean, healthy air. Recognizing the high asthma rates among her students, Mrs. Davis collaborated with The Point Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit that focused on the revitalization of the Hunts Point community through youth development and environmental justice. Working with The Point, Mrs. Davis became a part of the ‘Wrecking Crew,’ a group of parent activists concerned about the air quality in the South Bronx.

"Irving Berlin wrote ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" for the first Friars Frolic in 1911. George M. Cohan wrote ""Over There"" at the Clubhouse. Victor Herbert wrote and sang his ""Here's To the Friars"" for his Testimonial Dinner in 1907. For a century the Friars Club has seen itself grow from a meeting in 1904 of the Press Agents Association at Browne's Chop House, to the most prestigious entertainment organization in the world. Its history, steeped in show business tradition, has been written through such exalted events as its Testimonial Dinners, Roasts and Friars Frolics. 

Through the early leadership of Abbot George M. Cohan and the dedication of personalities such as Victor Herbert and Enrico Caruso, the Friars Club established itself in the early part of the century as a leading force in the entertainment world. 

From its early headquarters known as the Hermitage, located at 107 West 45th St. (1908-1916) the Friars congregated both informally and at orchestrated tributes honoring the celebrities and personalities of the day. 

Oscar Hammerstein, in 1908, was among the first to be honored with a Testimonial Dinner and in 1911 Abbot Cohan, along with Will Rogers, Irving Berlin and Victor Herbert and his orchestra, assembled a star studded cast for the first Friars Frolics. The Frolics were known the world over and brought the music and comedy of the Friars to theaters throughout the country. The proceeds from the Frolics enabled the Friars, in 1916, to build new and larger facilities at 106 West 48th Street where they continued to hold in-house galas, resplendent in sophistication, rich in music, and overflowing with acerbic comedy. As early as 1910, the Friars were noted for their ""roasting"" techniques, ""When a man subjects himself to being honored at the hands of the Friars, he needs a steel corselet to repel the jabs of his kidders,"" quoted a New York Tribune review of the Testimonial Dinner in honor of theatrical manager, William Harris. 

 In 1932 the depression, coupled with the westward movement of the entertainment industry, forced the Friars into some lean years. They lost the 48th Street building and, in an effort to keep their ranks united, relocated first to the Lindy's building then the Edison Hotel. In 1948, with the Friars membership fortified and the entertainment never diminishing, Abbot Milton Berle located the Club to 128 West 56th Street and finally, in 1957, to its current home at 57 East 55th Street. 

In 1988 the Friars welcomed women to join the formerly all-male bastion. Liza Minnelli became the first official female Friar and through the years their ranks have grown steadily among the Membership. 

When people think of the Friars Club they may think of its Testimonial Dinners, its Roasts, its Frolics, its comedians, its charities, its history whatever the context, it is undeniably unique.

"The following biographical information was provided by the Knights of Columbus. 

Father Michael McGivney was born in Waterbury on August 12, 1852. The oldest of thirteen children of Irish immigrants Patrick and Mary (Lynch) McGivney, Michael learned early about sorrow, the harsh grip of poverty, love and faith, and family fortitude. Six of his siblings died in infancy or childhood. At the age of 13 he left school to work in a spoon-making department of a brass factory to provide a few more dollars for family survival. When he reached the age of sixteen, he traveled to Quebec, Canada with his Waterbury pastor and registered at the French-run College of St. Hyacinthe. With the priesthood clearly in mind, he worked hard on subjects that would prepare him to apply for seminary admission. He studied two additional years at Our Lady of Angels Seminary in Niagra Falls, New York. He then moved to Montreal to attend seminary classes at the Jesuit-run St. Mary's College.  

When his father died in June of 1873, he went home for the funeral concerned for his family's welfare, lingering awhile in Waterbury. Then, at the request of the bishop of Hartford, he entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. On December 22, 1877, he was ordained in Baltimore's historic Cathedral of the Assumption by Archbishop (later Cardinal) James Gibbons. A few days later, he said his first Mass at Immaculate Conception Church in Waterbury. Father McGivney began his priestly ministry on Christmas Day in 1877 as curate at St. Mary's Church in New Haven. It was the city's first parish. A new stone church had been built, after the old one burned, on one of New Haven's finest residential Streets, Hillhouse Avenue. There was neighborhood objection which even the New York Times noted in 1879, under the headline: ""How An Aristocratic Avenue Was Blemished By A Roman Church Edifice."" So Father McGivney's priestly ministry in New Haven began with tension and defensiveness among the working-class Irish families he served.  

Father McGivney worked closely with the young people of St. Mary's parish, holding catechism classes and organizing a total abstinence society to fight alcoholism. In 1881 he began to explore with various laymen the idea of a Catholic, fraternal benefit society. In an era when parish clubs and fraternal societies had wide popular appeal, the young priest felt there should be some way to strengthen religious faith and at the same time provide for the financial needs of families overwhelmed by illness or death of the breadwinner. He discussed this concept with Bishop Lawrence McMahon of Hartford, and received his approval. He traveled to Boston to talk with the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters, and traveled to Brooklyn to consult the Catholic Benevolent Legion. He met with other priests of the diocese. Wherever he could, he sought information that would help the Catholic laymen to organize themselves into a benefit society.  

William Geary, one of the Order's charter members, said that at the first council meeting in 1882, he was ""acclaimed as founder by 24 men with hearts full of joy and thanksgiving, recognizing that without his optimism, his will to succeed, his counsel and advice they would have failed."" Father McGivney had suggested Sons of Columbus as a name for the Order. This would bind Catholicism and Americanism together through the faith and bold vision of the New World's discoverer.  

The word ""knights"" replaced ""sons"" because key members of the organizing group who were Irish-born Civil War veterans felt it would help to apply a noble ritual in support of the emerging cause of Catholic civil liberty. In the first public reference to the Order on February 8, 1882, the New Haven Morning Journal and Courier said the Knights of Columbus' initial meeting had been held the night before. On March 29, the Connecticut legislature granted a charter to the Knights of Columbus, formally establishing it as a legal corporation. The Order's principles in 1882 were ""Unity"" and ""Charity."" The concepts of ""Fraternity"" and ""Patriotism"" were added later. Each of these ideals played a major role in ceremonials from the beginning. The Columbus-linked themes, says historian Christopher J. Kauffman, ""reverberated with pride in the American promise of liberty, equality and opportunity.""  

In April of 1882, Father McGivney, with the permission of Bishop McMahon, wrote to all the pastors of the Diocese of Hartford. The Order's primary objective, he wrote, was to dissuade Catholics from joining secret societies by providing them better advantages at times of death or sickness. He urged each pastor to exert influence ""in the formation of a Council in your parish."" Father McGivney personally installed the first officers of San Salvador Council No. 1 in New Haven, in May of 1882.  

By May 1883, Council No. 2 had been instituted in Meriden, Connecticut and Bishop McMahon, so impressed with the organization, became a member of Council No. 11 in 1884, and served it as council chaplain. By the end of 1885, there were 31 councils in Connecticut.  

Father McGivney's dedication to the Order was evidenced in trips he made to all parts of Connecticut and in handwritten correspondence—little of which survives—about K of C business. At St. Mary's, despite all this, he remained the energetic curate with constant concern for every parishioner's problems. Then in November of 1884, he was named pastor of St. Thomas Church in Thomaston, Connecticut, a factory town 10 miles from his hometown. It was a factory parish, heavily in debt, serving working-class parishioners with few resources beyond their faith. With prayerful acceptance, Father McGivney put his seven years at St. Mary's behind him.  

His New Haven parishioners, in a testimonial resolution elaborately superimposed on the drawing of a chalice and host, declared that despite burdens and afflictions, his courtesy, his kindness and the purity of his life had ""secured the love and confidence of the people of St. Mary's, which will follow him in every future field of labor.""  

In six subsequent years at St. Thomas, he wrestled with the church debt and built the same close ties of devotion and charitable concern he had developed in New Haven. He continued, as well, to serve as supreme chaplain, personally involved in helping the Order to extend its membership into Rhode Island. Later, from 1901 to 1939, his younger brothers, Msgrs. Patrick and John J. McGivney, served the Order as supreme chaplains.  

Never robust in health, Father McGivney was suddenly stricken with a serious case of pneumonia in January 1890. It hung on. Various treatments for consumptive illness were tried, but his decline persisted. The young priest lost physical strength just as the Order he founded was moving toward new vitality. On August 14, 1890, Father Michael J. McGivney died at the age of 38. In his 13 brief, busy years as a priest, Father McGivney's piety and compassion had won the love of those he served as curate and pastor. His Christian inspiration, leadership and administrative drive had brought him the loyalty and affection of thousands who knew him as the founder of the Knights of Columbus.

"Juan Pablo Duarte, born in the city of Santo Domingo on January 26, 1813, is considered the “Founding Father of the Dominican Republic”. He was the son of a Spanish merchant and, as a teenager, he was sent to Spain to continue his studies. During this time he was greatly influenced by Catalonia’s “autonomous community” goals. When he returned to Santo Domingo in 1838, he found that young Dominicans were resentful of Haitian rule. The Haitian domination of eastern portion of the island of Hispaniola had begun in 1822. The political unification of Hispaniola brought liberation to the slaves, land reforms, and political rights for all the people living on the eastern part of the island. Haitian domination made the Dominican people recognize the importance of self-government and political participation. Haitian law recognized political participation but Dominicans were actually considered a minority with few rights. 

Is was in this atmosphere that Juan Pablo Duarte created a secret society, called “La Trinitaria”, in 1838 so that the yearning for liberty and self-government could be further intensified. He developed a political underground movement that organized the youth of the most important cities of the eastern part of Hispaniola. To promote their goals they used flyers, “cantaletas” (serenades with songs that had political content), and presented dramas with political content through a cultural organization called “La Filantropica”. This organization was open to all, promoted cultural activities and was controlled by “La Trinitaria”. In 1843, La Trinitaria worked together with the “Reformista” movement from the western part of the island to overthrow Jean Pierre Boyer’s Regime. Though this did not end Haitian rule, the situation made it possible for the La Trinitaria movement to gain political strength and to work in the open during elections. 

Charles Herard, the leader of the Reformista movement and successor to Boyer, understood and mistrusted the political goals of the Trinitaria. After he was elected president in 1843 Herard persecuted the “La Trinitaria” movement and Duarte was forced to escape to Curacaco while his closest collaborators went into hiding. However, the movement toward independence continued to grow even with Duarte in exile. On February 27, 1844 the forces for independence issued a proclamation declaring the freedom of the Dominican Republic. Duarte returned and he immediately took charge of the army. This situation was short lived, however, for another political group that also promoted annexation took over the government and jailed Duarte. He was sent into exile within a year. 

Duarte retired to an isolated village in Venezuela and remained away from his country for twenty years. In 1861, Spain took over the Dominican Republic and made it a colony. War broke out in 1863 against Spanish rule and Duarte returned the following year to fight again for Dominican Independence. He was sent on a diplomatic mission by the provisional Dominican government to solicit funding for the war from neighboring countries. After independence was reestablished he returned to Venezuela. He died there in 1876, having devoted his entire life to the independence of the Dominican Republic.

In 1916, he was elected president of the Muslim League, which represented the interests of Indian Muslims in a predominantly Hindu country. He resigned from the Indian National Congress in 1920, when the congress launched a movement of non-cooperation to boycott all aspects of British rule. After provincial elections in 1937, the congress refused to form coalition administrations with the Muslim League in mixed areas and relations between Hindus and Muslims began to deteriorate. In 1940, at a Muslim League session in Lahore, the first official demand was made for the partition of India and the creation of a Muslim state of Pakistan. While he had always believed that Hindu-Muslim unity was possible, he reluctantly came to the view that partition was necessary to safeguard the rights of Indian Muslims.

She was a founding member of the Southeast Queens Community Corporation which funded various educational, recreational, housing, career training and Summer Youth Employment programs throughout southeast Queens for several years.  During the 1990’s the corporation was a life-line program for many young people in southeast Queens deterring youths from choices leading to criminal activities, as well as providing meaningful second chance opportunities.  She was a founding member of the Southern Queens Park Association (SQPA), the first public private partnership instituted on what is now presently known as Roy Wilkins Park.  For over thirty-five years, the SQPA was seen as a beacon providing the much needed resources to maintain the property, and attract local residents. Under Ms. Moore’s tenure, Roy Wilkins Park has seen much growth, in particular, the establishment of a community garden for residents to grow fresh produce, as well as, a learning opportunity for several residents interested in composting, planting and growing their own.  She volunteered for several community service organizations including, the Proctor Hopson Post #1896 to help returning veterans from the Vietnam and Gulf War to adjust to civilian lives, as an Advisory Board Member to York College she promoted access to higher education, and as a Jamaica NAACP Board Member, she fought against injustice in education and social policies.

"James Baldwin was a writer and civil rights activist and is considered one of the greatest writers of his generation.  He would later become a prominent figure of the Civil Rights Movement.  He was born in Harlem and at age fourteen became a member of the Pentecostal Church where he began to preach.  In the early 1940s, he abandoned his religious faith to focus on literature.  He began writing short stories, essays and book reviews which were published in Notes of a Native Son in 1955.  His most known and celebrated work is his partially autobiographical novel Go Tell It On The Mountain.  His writings denounce racism and more precisely the injustices done to the African-American community in the United States in the 1920s. The book is considered one of the literary masterpieces of that era.  In 1956, he published Giovanni’s Room in which he openly discusses the issues of race and homosexuality.  In 1957 he returned to the United States to participate in the Civil Rights Movement alongside Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.  In 1961, he published an important essay on race relations and the role of writers in society entitled Nobody Knows my Name: More Notes of a Native Son, which would be followed in 1962 by the novel Another Country.  In 1963, he published The Fire Next Time which is widely considered one of the most brilliant essays on the history of black protest.  He also wrote two plays, The Amen Corner (1955), and, Blues for Mister Charlie (1964).  He won the prestigious George Polk prize in 1963.  In 1987, the “National James Baldwin Literary Society” was founded and in 1992, Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, the institution of higher learning where he taught in the 1980s started the “James Baldwin Scholar Program” which provides scholarships to talented students from undeserved communities who would benefit from a transition year before college.  His short story “Sonny’s Blues” is often included in anthologies of fiction studied in college literature seminars.  He was included in Molefi Kete Asante’s, founder of the first PhD program in African American Studies, dictionary as one of 100 Greatest African Americans.  Also, in 2005, the United States Postal Service made a first-class stamp dedicated to James Baldwin.

"Paseo Park is a 26-block open street along 34th Avenue from 69th Street to Junction Boulevard in Jackson Heights. Its name is meant to acknowledge the diverse immigrant communities that line the open street while also evoking the new purpose of the street space (""paseo"" means ""stroll"" in Spanish). Paseo Park was borne out of a collective need for safe gathering space and community connection in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its birth in 2020, local community organizations and the Department of Transportation have worked toward permanently transforming this open street into a vibrant network of safe open spaces, many of which have been converted to 100% car-free plazas.

"Jessie Streich-Kest was killed on October 29, 2012 by a falling tree limb while walking her dog.  She was a committed social activist, an energetic and enthusiastic public school teacher, a passionate lover of animals and a supportive daughter and friend.  She attended Edward R. Murrow High School in Midwood and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2009.  It was her experience at Murrow that first inspired her to become a public school teacher. In college, Jessie worked as a field staffer in the first Obama campaign. After college, she took a job with the Schneiderman campaign, running the Brooklyn operation at just 22 years old. Her passion was to become a teacher. She began to fulfill that goal when she was accepted into the New Visions/Hunter Urban Teacher Residency program for the 2011-12 school year.  In September of 2012, she launched her career as a NYC public school teacher after receiving her Masters of Education. She was teaching 10th grade Special Education students at the Bushwick School for Social Justice.  Her impact in the school lingers to this day in the spirit she brought to the SPED department and the systems and changes she put in place to service BSSJ’s neediest students.  Prior to that year, SPED students passed classes at an average of about 55-60%.  In the past two years, those rates rose to 75% and above in most classes and have stayed there since.  In just a few short months, Jessie contributed to the lasting strength of the school community.  She was a committed animal rights activist who fought for an end to the abuse of carriage horses.  As a passionate member of NYCLASS, she co-led protests against horse carriages in Central Park and had most recently lent her passion to New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets.

"The Piccirilli family, parents, six sons and a daughter, arrived in New York City in 1888 from Massa-Carrara in Tuscany, Italy where the father, Giuseppe, operated a sculpture studio. By 1893, they established a residence and sculpture studio at 467 E. 142nd Street in the Mott Haven section of The Bronx. The studio closed in 1945, the year that three of the brothers died. It was demolished in the 1970’s and the site is currently occupied by a Jehovah’s Witness Kingdom Hall. 

Original Piccirilli sculptures can be found throughout New York City and the United States. The Maine Monument at the southwest corner of Central Park (near Columbus Circle) is probably the best known original Piccirilli work. Other original Piccirilli sculptures in New York City include the Fireman’s memorial on Riverside Drive and West 100th Street, the large glass sculpture, “Youth Leading Industry”, over the entrance to 636 Fifth Avenue in Rockefeller Center (opposite St. Patrick’s Cathedral) and the Policeman’s Memorial at One Police Plaza. 

The brothers, Ferruccio, Attilio, Furio, Masaniello, Orazio and Grtulio, were also master marble carvers. Many sculptures brought their plaster casts to the studio to be carved in marble. Their best-known carving project was the Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C.’s Lincoln Memorial. In New York they carved the Library Lions at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, all of the sculptures on the Washington Arch in Greenwich Village, the pediment of the New York Stock Exchange, and many others. 

In between commissions for large public sculptures, the brothers produced many small works – often for their own artistic interests. Most of these are in museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or in private collections. 

Attilio was co-founder of the Leonardo da Vinci Art School originally located at 288 East 10th Street in Manhattan. The school offered art education to thousands of working class New Yorkers from 1923 to 1940. Several students won the prestigious Prix de Rome, and Isamu Noguchi received his early training at “The Leonardo”. 

The Piccirilli brothers kept a fairly low profile but were well known in certain circles. Virtually all the sculptors of their time visited the studio. Some worked there, and some actually lived there. The studio had become an important center for American art. Teddy Roosevelt, Enrico Caruso, and John D. Rocafeller also visited the studio. Fiorello LaGuardia was a close friend to the family for decades. “The Leonardo” received testimonials from Calvin Coolidge, Thomas Edison, Al Smith and many, many others.

"The following biographical material was provided by the Wilson family. 

Fred Wilson was born Wilfred Wilson in Harlem on November 20, 1929 to Siefert and Winifred Wilson. He received his diploma from Commerce High School and studied liberal arts at the City University of New York. 

Mr. Wilson began his dedicated career as a public servant as a defender of his country by enlisting in the United States Army from which he received an honorable discharge in August 1953. Upon discharge, Fred Wilson embarked on a successful twenty-two year career in the newspaper business and rose to the position of production supervisor for the New York Herald Tribune. 

Fred Wilson married Currin Jones in September 1955 and had two children, Cheryl and Eric. Upon moving into the Rochdale Village Cooperative in Jamaica, Queens when it opened in the early 1960’s, Mr. Wilson became significantly involved with his community. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of Rochdale Village and as president of the Rochdale Village Black Society. He was very involved in the education of his children and he became an active member of the local PTA. Mr. Wilson was also a member of the Pride of Jamaica Lodge 217. 

In 1972, Fred Wilson was elected Democratic District Leader of the 32nd Assembly District and served in that capacity for twelve years. As a party official, he became an active member of the Council of Black Elected Democrats of New York State. His district was very diverse and included blacks, whites, Jews and Gentiles. He quickly became a respected member of the Queens County Democratic Party Executive Committee.  

Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, the 32nd A.D. Regular Democratic Club became a major political force in the Southeast Queens community. Candidates for all levels of public office learned that the 32nd had a reputation for “delivering the vote” and vigorously sought the club’s endorsement. His club also became a community center of sorts. A number of community organizations held meetings and functions there and residents from the surrounding area frequently came into Mr. Wilson’s club seeking help for various problems. 

In 1976, Fred Wilson became known as “Hollywood Fred” when he was selected by the Democratic National Committee to be flown to Hollywood to be featured in a film that was presented at the Democratic National Convention in New York. He looked upon this event as one of the major highlights of his career. 

Politics was his business but people were his passion. Mr. Wilson listened to the concerns of his constituents and he took everyone’s problems to heart. If there was an emergency, you could count on Fred Wilson twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Fred also gave special attention to getting young people involved in the political process. He knew that the vote could effect change. He mentored young people with discipline and guidance. Fred Wilson encouraged young people to volunteer in the community and he spent many hours working side by side with young folks. 

Fred Wilson died in December 1984. He was survived by his wife, his two children and three grandchildren. In appreciative recognition of the many years of devoted service that he gave to the Jamaica community it is fitting that Bedell Street, between Baisley Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, the site of Rochdale Village where he lived for over 20 years, be named “Fred Wilson Way” in his honor.

"For nearly 40 years, the name Carmichael in Southeast Queens was synonymous with good, downhome southern country soul food, business powerbrokers, jazz, and “after church brunch on Sunday.” The Carmichael’s diner, liquor store and auto shop/gas station were Southeast Queens institutions and a testament to family unity, hard work, dedication, and community support and loyalty. Natives of South Carolina, the Carmichael family joined the approximately six million African Americans during ""The Great Migration"" (1910-1970) as African American southerners relocate to northern and Midwestern cities, including: New York City, in pursuit of better paying jobs, escape from racial violence, economic and educational opportunities, and obtain to freedom from the oppression of Jim Crow.

"Boaz Vaadia was an internationally known sculptor who used bluestone mined from New York City streets for his figurative pieces. He was born in Israel and grew up in a farming community.  He moved to New York in 1975. Born in Gat Rimon in 1951, Vaadia grew up in a rural community where his parents, Nissim Vaadia and Rivka Horozlaski, farmed strawberries. In 1968, he enrolled at the Avni Institute of Fine Arts in Tel Aviv but was drafted into the Israeli Army just a year later. After completing his service, he returned to school and began teaching there after graduating. In 1975, with a grant from America-Israel Cultural Foundation, he relocated to New York, where he studied at the Pratt Institute. The artist said he thought the move was “the worst mistake of my life,” but “within one week I actually recognized that the urban environment of New York is as natural as my village.” Vaadia began collecting materials such as slate, shingles, bluestone, and boulders after he discovered an ongoing construction project near his studio in SoHo. As workers ripped up the bluestone sidewalk, Vaadia carried the discarded material to his loft, where he worked with a hammer and chisel to further expose the sedimentary layers of the rocks. Inspired by the stratified layers, he began creating sculptures that echoed the natural composition of his materials. As his artistic output grew, he relocated to a studio in Williamsburg and started collecting boulders, but he was eventually forced to order materials. Primarily named after biblical figures, his public works can be found outdoors in parks and in front of businesses, as well as in the collections of institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, SF MoMA, the Bass Museum of Art, and the Tel Aviv Museum. He is best known for his generic figures made from layers of rock. They adorn sculpture parks, commercial buildings, and private and museum collections around the world. His work, which includes bronzes and slate sculptures as well, is also on view in London, Tel Aviv and New Orleans and is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

"The following biographical material was provided by Dick Zigun and Charles Denson.  Rubin “Ruby” Jacobs was born in Coney Island on May 5, 1922.  He spent his entire life living and promoting the Coney Island lifestyle as a lifelong resident, as a Second World War veteran, as a bath house operator and as a bar and restaurant proprietor.  Ruby’s always pleasant promotion of the beach made him a tireless spokesman for Coney Island, whether talking to the national press or speaking one on one with customers.  His last establishment, Ruby’s Bar, remains to this day an unofficial old timers hangout and museum with hundreds of photos of Coney Island in its heyday. 

The many conveyed a charm and inner peace that he always attributed to the beach, which he referred to as “the elixir of life.”  Coney Island is an amusement park that cannot compete with Disneyland of Great Adventure in terms of state of the art rides, but Coney Island is the richest amusement park in the world when we value proprietors and advocates such as Ruby Jacobs. 

Few people loved and believed in Coney Island as much as Ruby Jacobs, who was sometimes called “the jewel” of Coney Island.  For over forty years, in a very quiet way, Ruby provided a safe haven for visitors while preserving the celebrated traditions of “the World’s Most Famous Playground.”  During the 1960’s and 1970’s, Ruby operated Coney Island’s historic boardwalk bathhouses and landmarks with a rich and storied past: Stauch’s, Claret’s, and Bushman’s. 

When the last of the bathhouses closed, Ruby opened the Old Tyme Restaurant, which he operated with his brother Phil.  The establishment became famous both as a gallery displaying historic images of Coney Island’s past glories and as a popular gathering place for old timers and new visitors alike. 

When others gave up on the area during its decline, Ruby refused to do so.  His love and passion for Coney Island never wavered.  When a customer asked him what the best thing on the restaurant’s menu was, he would reply with a wave of his hand, “Look out there in the ocean, smell the air and look at the whole tapestry of people that come to Coney Island.  That’s the best item on the menu.”  Ruby Jacobs died on April 5, 2000.

"Jacob Birnbaum founded the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry and is considered the father of the Movement to Free Soviet Jewry.  He was born in Hamburg, Germany, and after Hitler came to power in 1933, his family moved to London.   He worked with survivors of Nazi concentration camps and Soviet labor camps, and with North African Jews who had fled the civil war in Algeria.  He moved to New York in 1964 and soon started his campaign to help Soviet Jews.  He orchestrated the movement to free Soviet Jews with student demonstrations at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations beginning in 1964.  On April 27, 1964, in the Philosophy Hall on the Columbia University campus, around 200 students from Yeshiva University, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Queens College and Columbia gathered to plan the May Day protest.  The May Day protest consisted of a thousand young men and women, almost all Jewish, who answered his summons who marched silently in two neat rows for four hours in the conservative clothes they wore to synagogue.  Other demonstrations, some of which attracted as many as 3,000 protesters, were held on Jewish holidays and every rally included posters declaring “Let my people go,” the line from Exodus 9:1 that became the clarion call of the movement.  His demand was free emigration, not just an easing of restrictions.  He publicized the cases of individual Jews in Russia, despite mainstream organizations’ worries that this might endanger them.  He tried to expose Soviet anti-Semitism and hypocrisy, in the belief that Moscow was more sensitive to international opinion than many thought.  He lobbied Washington, and personally conveyed his support to Soviet “refuseniks” who protested being denied permission to emigrate.  His grass-roots movement contributed to legislation that eventually helped liberalize Moscow’s emigration policies, an issue that President Ronald Reagan personally pressed the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on.  As a result, more than 1.5 million Soviet Jews were allowed to move to Israel and elsewhere.

"Willie Mays was born on May 6, 1931, in Westfield, Alabama, and began playing baseball at an early age. He played in the minor leagues for two seasons and was picked up by the New York Giants in 1951. Although having no hits in his first twelve at bats, he finally hit a home run over the left field fence of the Polo Grounds and from then on, his batting average improved throughout the season and won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award. In the 1951 World Series, Mays was part of the first all-African-America outfield in major league history along with Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin in game one of the series. Mays was drafted by the United States Army in 1952 during the Korean War and missed most of the 1952 season and all of the 1953 season. He returned to the Giants in 1954 and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year. Also, the Giants won the National League pennant and went on to dominate in the 1954 World Series. In this series, Mays made an over-the-shoulder running grab referred to as, “The Catch,” which is considered the iconic image of his career and one of baseball’s most memorable fielding plays which prevented two runners from scoring. In 1955, he led the league with 51 home runs and in 1956, he hit 36 home runs and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player to join the 30-30 Club. In 1957, he won the first of twelve consecutive Gold Glove Awards and also became the fourth player in Major League history to join the 20-20-20 Club. He also stole 38 bases that year and became the second player in baseball history to reach 20 in each of those four categories, doubles, triples, home runs, steals in the same season. After the 1957 season, Mays moved with the Giants franchise to San Francisco. One of his best games was on April 30, 1961 when Mays hit four home runs against the Milwaukee Braves. In 1970, Mays was named the 1960’s “Player of the Decade.” In 1972, Mays was traded to the New York Mets where he retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 with 660 home runs, 7,095 fielding putouts in the outfield which remains the major league record and played in 24 All-Star games.  

After his retirement, Mays continued working with the New York Mets as a hitting instructor until the 1979 season. Later on, he became a full-time special assistant to the Giants for over 25 years and served on the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team helping former players with finances and medical issues. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in January 1979 and every May 24th in San Francisco is celebrated as Willie Mays Day. He was also very involved with his charity, the Say Hey Foundation which is dedicated to helping underprivileged youth. In addition, he is involved in charitable events such as the Giants Community Fund, the San Francisco Food Bank and the Whitney Young Child Development Center in Hunter’s Point. He has also received honorary degrees from Ohio State University, Ohio and Yale University, Connecticut and Mills College and Dartmouth. He was honored by Major League Baseball and the Giants at the 2007 All-Star game for his lifetime achievements and was also honored with the Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point officially becoming the Willie Mays Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point after the clubhouse was rebuilt. The Sporting News ranked him second among the 100 greatest baseball players of the century and was listed eighth of the top 50 athletes of the century by ESPN.

"(The following biographical information was provided by the “All Music Guide” and “Thomson Gale” websites.) 

Celia Cruz was one of Latin music's most respected vocalists. A ten-time Grammy nominee, Cruz, who sang only in her native Spanish language, received a Smithsonian Lifetime Achievement award, a National Medal of the Arts and honorary doctorates from Yale University and the University of Miami. A street in Miami was renamed in her honor, and Cruz' trademark orange, red and white polka dot dress and shoes have been placed in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institute of Technology. The Hollywood Wax Museum includes a statue of the Cuba-born songstress.  

Celia Cruz was born in Havana, Cuba on October 21, 1924. Growing up in the city’s poor Santo Suárez neighborhood in a household of 14 children, she stood out because of her singing ability. Cruz won a singing contest called “La hora del té” and with her mother’s encouragement began to enter other contests in various parts of Cuba. 

Cruz’s father, however, believed that she should become a teacher, an altogether more common profession for a Cuban woman at the time. She enrolled at the national teachers’ college, but dropped out after finding more and more success with her music in live and radio performances. Something of a compromise was reached when she enrolled at Havana’s National Conservatory of Music—but there a professor encouraged her to consider a full time singing career. 

Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead vocalist for a big band called La Sonora Mantancera. Bandleader Regilo Martinez showed faith in Cruz when he continued to feature her despite the protests of fans of the band’s previous vocalist, and once again when an American record executive resisted the idea of making a Sonora Matencera disc that featured Cruz, believing that a rumba record with a female vocalist would not sell well. Martinez promised to pay Cruz himself if the recording flopped. It did well in both Cuba and the United States, and Cruz toured widely through Central and North America with La Sonora Matancera in the 1950’s. 

At the time of the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, the group was slated to tour Mexico. However, from Mexico, rather than returning to Cuba, they entered the United States and remained there. Cruz herself became a U.S citizen in 1961. Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro was furious and barred Cruz from returning to Cuba, enforcing the ban even after Cruz’s parents deaths. Cruz for her part vowed not to return to Cuba until such time as the Castro regime was deposed. 

Celia Cruz died on July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

"The Society of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was founded in 1903 as a self-help organization open to immigrant Italians, irrespective of their towns of origin or native regional affiliations in the old country.  It was under the tenure of the society's first president Joseph A. Palma (1903-1914) that the organization purchased land and erected a meeting hall on White Plains Avenue between St. Mary's Avenue, and Amity Street in Rosebank, Staten Island. 

In 1937, Vito Russo, and 46 other members of the Society, built a shrine honoring Our Lady of Mount Carmel, on Amity Street around the corner from Mount Carmel Hall.  The serpentine grotto is built out of stone blocks, brick, and cement.  It has a central chapel housing a statue of Our Lady of Mt.  Carmel, which is flanked by two wings.  The grotto's surface is decorated with stones, shells, bicycle reflectors, marbles, and glass flowers inlaid in cement in a variety of shapes such as ovals, diamonds, crosses, and stars.  Niches and shelves hold a host of Catholic saints such as St.  Jude, St.  Anthony of Pauda, St.  Anne, St.  Lucy, and others.  Vito Russo acted as custodian to this property until his death in 1954. 

In 2001, the property where the Our Lady of Mount Carmel’s Grotto and Meeting Hall stands was placed on the New York and National Registers of Historic Places.

On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 A.M.  American Airlines Flight 11, a jet carrying 92 passengers that was hijacked on a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center.  The impact of the jet tore a huge hole in the building and set it afire, trapping hundreds of people on the upper floors.  At 9:03 A.M.  a second hijacked jet airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, with 65 passengers also out of Boston, crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center.  The plane exploded causing a fire that trapped everyone in the building who was above the point of impact.  Within the next ninety minutes both towers collapsed. 

Despite the heroic efforts of New York City’s Fire Department, Police Department, Emergency Services Unit, and hundreds of civilians, more than 2,800 people were killed when the World Trade Center came down.  Included among the casualties were firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, airline passengers and crewmembers, those who worked or had business in the World Trade Center, and civilians on the ground.  It is the view of the New York City Council, and millions of Americans, that all of the people who lost their lives in this terrorist attack are heroes as well as victims.  Today we celebrate their lives and mourn their passing by naming the following streets in honor of those heroes.   

While honoring them, we also acknowledge that it is but a modest gesture when compared to their great and ultimate sacrifice.

"Colin Luther Powell was born on April 5, 1937, and reared in the ethnically mixed Hunts Point section of the South Bronx. His parents, Luther Powell, a shipping-room foreman in Manhattan’s garment district, and Maud Ariel McKoy, a seamstress, were immigrants from Jamaica. Mr. Powell was a pathbreaker, serving as the country’s first Black national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state. The young Mr. Powell graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx, before attending City College of New York. An early turning point in Mr. Powell’s life came when he enrolled in the college’s Reserve Officer Training Corps program, drawn by the camaraderie it fostered, the discipline it imposed and its well-defined goals. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, a drill team started by Gen. John J. Pershing, a top American commander in World War I. After graduating from City College in June 1958, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army, serving two decorated combat tours in Vietnam. Mr. Powell rose quickly through the ranks, including gaining a battalion command in Korea in 1973, and a brigade command in the elite 101st Airborne Division in 1976. He was tapped as a “water walker” by his peers, a term military men reserve for the most talented officers. In 1979, he was promoted to one-star general, becoming the youngest general officer in the Army at the time. After serving as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger’s senior military assistant, Mr. Powell, in the spring of 1986, went off to command V Corps, skipping division command altogether in leading 75,000 soldiers in West Germany in the waning years of the Cold War. Just five months later, President Reagan summoned him back to Washington to be national security adviser, a post in which he played a pivotal role in helping to usher in a new era of cooperation with Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Powell left the White House in 1989 to return to lead the Army’s Forces Command; the promotion made him only the fourth Black four-star general in Army history. He saw himself not only as a model for Black soldiers but also as a challenge to white bigotry. In October 1989, Mr. Powell succeeded Adm. William J. Crowe as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, leapfrogging over 14 more senior four-star officers. Mr. Powell retired from the Joint Chiefs in 1993. He returned to government in December 2000, when he was the first person appointed to the cabinet of President-elect George W. Bush. He left office in January 2005, returning to life as a private citizen.

"The following biographical material was provided by the family and friends of William “Sonny” Ressel. 

William “Sonny” Ressel was born to Isadore and Ida Ressel on May 20, 1932, on New York City’s Lower Eastside. He attended Public School 4 and later graduated from Seward Park High School in that area.  In 1952, Sonny married the love of his life Rosalie (Ricki) Becker, and the couple moved to Ocean Parkway and Avenue F, in the Kensington area of Brooklyn, where they lived for more than forty years. While there, their marriage was blessed with a son named Stephen. 

Sonny Ressel and his family were active members of the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center for many years and he became a member of the organization’s Board of Directors. During that time he helped with fund-raising, worked on many committees and became a full-time Community Activist.  Sonny Ressel also saw the need for a neighborhood association in Kensington to monitor quality of life issues. When the New Kensington Neighborhood Association (NKNA) was founded in 1988, he joined immediately. He helped with the organization’s recycling efforts before New York City had recycling laws. Ever vigilant, Sonny Ressel always called the Department of Transportation with information about defective street lights on any of the streets in the neighborhood. If he saw any irregularity in the area, such as clogged sewer drains, broken tree limbs or crime indicators, such as broken car windows, he made sure that NKNA addressed the problem and that the proper authorities were notified. On one occasion Sonny Ressel protested, along with local politicians and community activists to bring about the close of a business on McDonald Avenue that was a known pornography and prostitution storefront. 

In 1994, Sonny Ressel became a Co-President of NKNA. His goal was to organize the community into an even more cohesive force to address quality of life issues and to maintain neighborhood decency standards. Sonny Ressel worked hand in hand with the 66th and 76th Police Precincts to protect the Kensington community until his death on February 9, 1999. He was survived by his wife Ricki, his son Stephen, and his sister Laura Edelstein. 

Sonny Ressel was a devoted community activist who worked tirelessly, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to achieve and maintain high quality of life standards for Kensington.

Dominick Sabatino was a civic minded business-oriented, man who fought for a bridge to be built between 61st and 62nd Streets on 13th Avenue where an open BMT subway ditch separated one end of the sheet from the other. For 9 years, representing the local merchants association, he appealed to Brooklyn Borough President Raymond Ingersoll to help get the bridge constructed for the social and economic betterment of the community. At Mr. Sabatino’s urging, the bridge was eventually built uniting the two ends of 13th Avenue from 39th Street to 86th Street. The bridge, which connected the Borough Park and New Utrect sections of Brooklyn, opened on October 12, 1939. 

Dominick Sabatino died at Borough Hall in Brooklyn in 1957. Today, only 3 of his children survive, the youngest is in his late seventies.

"The Punjabis or Punjabi people are an ethnic group associated with the Punjab region in South Asia, specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, presently divided between Punjab, India and Punjab, Pakistan. Historically, the Punjabi people were a heterogeneous group and were subdivided into a number of clans called biradari (literally meaning ""brotherhood"") or tribes, with each person bound to a clan. However, Punjabi identity also included those who did not belong to any of the historical tribes. With the passage of time, tribal structures are coming to an end and are being replaced with a more cohesive and holistic society, as community building and group cohesiveness form the new pillars of Punjabi society. In relative contemporary terms, Punjabis can be referred to in three most common subgroups: Punjabi Muslims, Punjabi Sikhs and Punjabi Hindus. Due to political, social and economic factors a significant number of Punjabi Sikhs have immigrated to build their homes throughout the nation—particularly in the last three decades or so. Specifically, Richmond Hill, New York, has a high concentration of these immigrants and is a community that can be identified as a Punjabi Sikh enclave. As this demographic group continues to grow and foster a particular social environment, the children of Punjabi immigrants have forged a unique identity in which they balance the traditional values of their family’s heritage with the intricacies of urban America. The obstacles they face originate because of different structural, communal and cultural reasons. These problems work together to be a heavy burden on the youth of a community that is still very much assimilating into the nation’s landscape. Although there are Punjabi youth from the community who are beginning to access the resources and education they need in order to uplift themselves and their families, much more is needed in order to develop the ability of this first generation group to navigate through the hurdles they face in order to experience the prosperity that their parents dreamed of.

"The following historical information was provided by the St. Stephen of Hungary Parish of New York City. 

King Stephen was born Vajk, in 977 AD, son of Grand Prince Geza of the Magyars. Dedicated to the welfare of his people and committed to the strengthening of his people through intellectual and moral means, Geza invited Christian missionaries of the reform Benedictines from Cluny, France into his realm. As an example to his people, he had missionaries instruct his son and baptize him under the name Istvan or Stephen. 

Stephen succeeded his father as Grand Prince of the Magyars in 997. Recognizing the energetic and responsible leadership of this young ruler on the eastern flank of Europe, Pope Sylvester II in 1000 granted Stephen the title of King of Hungary and sent papal emissaries to him with a crown symbolic of the new title and a double barred archbishop’s cross indicative of the establishment of a separate church organization for the newly independent nation. Since then, this crown and cross have become the radical confirmation of legitimate constitutional authority in Hungary and a rallying symbol of national identity and strength during the occupations of the Turks, the Austrians, the Nazis and the Soviets. The coronation of Stephen also focused Hungary toward the west. 

Stephen organized the secular and religious life of Hungary in a manner which endures, with slight change, to the present. He invited foreigners, especially those who were refugees from oppression, into Hungary so that they could each enrich it with their customs, languages, and creativity. In this fashion, Stephen anticipated the “melting pot” concept of society, as we know it today. In his personal life, Stephen lived as an outstanding example of a husband and a father to such a extent that he and his son Prince Imre, or Emeric, were recognized as Catholic saints, and his wife, Queen Gesilla, was recognized as a Catholic blessed. Outstanding for his service to the poor and destitute and stalwart in using his political power for the defense of the powerless, Stephen shortly before he died, officially offered his crown to God as the only true ruler.  

December 20, 2000 marked the millennium of the coronation of Stephen as the first monarch of the Magyars (Hungarians). In recognition of this event, Pastors of the Hungarian churches of New York City have requested the permanent renaming of East 82nd Street, between York Avenue and Third Avenue, to “King Stephen of Hungary Way”.  This will include the East 82nd Street, between First and York Avenues, location of St. Stephen’s Hungarian Church.

"The following biographical material was provided by the Amadou Diallo Educational and Charity Foundation. 

Amadou Diallo was born on September 2, 1975 in the village of Sinoe, Liberia, West Africa. He was the first of four children born to Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo. Amadou has one sister, Laouratou, and two brothers, Ibrahima and Abdul Salaam. Because his father, Saikou, was a businessman, Amadou traveled throughout much of his childhood living in Togo, Guinea, the homeland of his parents, Bangkok and Singapore. 

Amadou grew up with a love of reading, music, dancing and sports. Once in the United States, he became an avid basketball fan, in particular, of Michael Jordan. In fact, Amadou was such a true Michael Jordan fan that he shifted from a Bulls fan to a Knicks fan when Jordan had decided to retire. 

Amadou had a passion for school and attended some of the finest schools in the world, including The French International School, London's Cambridge University, The British Consulate College in Thailand and the Asian Institute of Microsoft. It was Amadou's dream to one day enroll in school in the United States. At twenty, he decided to come to America to continue his computer education and he wanted to do it on his own. In September of 1996, he decided to come to New York to start a business with his cousin. His father, Saikou, was reluctant at first but later relented after he was reassured by relatives that Amadou would be taken care of.  

Upon his arrival in New York, he first worked as a delivery man but later became a street peddler selling gloves, socks and video tapes in Manhattan on 14th Street. He worked six days a week, 12 hours a day. However, his dream to pursue his education in America continued. A young man from Senegal who met Amadou in New York fondly recalls the times he and Amadou would sit talking for hours about school. After class, he'd stop by Amadou's stand where Amadou would always have a cold bottle of apple juice waiting for him. He'd take his usual seat while Amadou would run down his usual questions; ""So tell me, how was school in America today? How do you feel about being in the classroom?"" He'd get so excited just listening and, at the end of every conversation, he'd say, ""You know, I'm really going to go to school here someday."" 

A spiritual person, when Amadou was about 18 years old, he began to focus and collect books on his religion, studying the Koran and praying five times a day in the Muslim tradition. When the family came to collect Amadou's belongings after his death, they found solace in what they discovered. Among the many things they found were writings where Amadou had begun to research the prophets. He had written the names of all the prophets along with the dates of their birth. He had highlighted passages in the Koran that spoke about the dialogues between Christians and Muslims. Amadou was on a spiritual journey. 

Amadou was killed on February 4, 1999, after midnight, by four New York City police officers from the Street Crime Unit. Amadou had come home from work to his apartment at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview Section of the Bronx and decided to go back out to get something to eat. Upon his return, he encountered the police officers who ultimately fired a fuselage of 41 shots, 19 of which riddled his body. Amadou died in the vestibule of his apartment building.

"Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Spiegel was born in 1936, and was a decedent of the Chzeh of Lubin Reb Rob Shmelke of Nikolsburg, Ramiraz Rokeach and other large Chasidic dynasties.  Rabbi Yaakov Spiegel was known as the Roumanisher Rav, for he was the beloved and respected leader of the Roumanisher Shul on the Lower East Side of New York City.  For over 20 years, he also served as the Rav of KBW Estates during the summer.   

Rabbi Spiegel began his illustrious career as the executive vice president of the federated council of Beth Jacob Schools (Esther Schonfeld), on the Lower East Side.  Almost single handedly, he established schools for thousands of girls, putting them at the forefront of the Bais Yaakov movement.  Thanks to his involvement, tens of millions of dollars were obtained to support Torah learning, both in the United States and Israel.  At his shiva, many women related stories of how he had helped ensure that young Jewish girls would receive a Jewish education regardless of their parents’ ability to pay tuition.

"Mary Davies was born on March 22, 1926, in the borough of Brooklyn, to Thomas and Helen Davies. Mary received her education attending various Brooklyn public schools, until her marriage to John Davies in 1937. Mary and her husband moved to Staten Island after World War II, and settled in the Great Kills area. Mary was a traditional stay at home mother, to daughter Mary and son John, but quickly became involved in the local PTA and community association. 

Mary Davies led the drive for implementation of the original South Richmond Plan, that called for control of the wetlands and natural areas. When it was defeated in the early 1960’s she helped found the Crescent Beach Civic Association to protect the coastline. She fought to have accessible transportation services for local senior citizens, to have a mobile van to provide Metro tickets sold in local areas, to require builders in the low areas have valid permits before putting in foundations that would ruin the costal water plane. When the battle for a new South Richmond Plan became about she joined forces with another Community Activist, Lorraine Sorge of the Taxpayers Association, and together the two organizations mobilized enough community support to have the plan adopted, thus saving the wet lands and open spaces from rapid over development. 

Until her death in September 2002, Mary was still engaged in fighting for the community by organizing the residents to protest the plans for a 181 unit housing development without adequate protection for the homeowners living in the low planes of Great Kills coastal area.

"Al Jolson was the singular and most influential stage personality and popular singer of the 20th century. Jolson was the unanimous king of Broadway for close to thirty years As a result his name was synonymous with the Winter Garden Theater. During his lifetime he was the acknowledged “World’s Greatest Entertainer,” at a time when the landscape was bursting with fabulous stars.   Although often confused and labeled as a racist because of his use of “Blackface,” nothing could be further from the truth. During the 1910’s and 20’s, a different time and society existed that saw Blackface as meaning something entirely different. Blackface was a tool, not to belittle a race of human beings, but to free the actor and to enable him to “take on” the characteristics inherent in the “mask,” as in the traditions of Greek theater and of the Commedia dell Arte. One need not even be portraying a black person to where Blackface and the black performers who did wear it (Bert Williams, considered the greatest comedian of the vaudeville era) did so to take advantage of its “stageness.” As such, Jolson’s use of Blackface is more closely and properly associated with Commedia dell’ Arte. His stage persona was likened by critics to that of the Harlequin, and was never done for the purposes of maligning the black race but, Jolson and his audience thought, for ennobling it.   Contrary to controversial opinions, Al Jolson was always something of a hero in the black community during his lifetime. Some reasons why:      Covering the Jack Johnson – Jim Jeffries boxing match of 1910 for Variety he was of very few reporters who had the courage to say that Johnson won the fight on his own merit and boxing ability. Other reporters, more concerned about the fighters color, made excuses for Jeffries, refusing to give Johnson full credit for his victory. Jolson was one of very few reporters to accurately credit Johnson’s superior boxing talents. This is forgotten and ignored.      As early as 1911 Jolson fought for equality on the Broadway stage. On his return from San Francisco, he brought with him to New York the black dance team of Johnny Peters and Mary Dewson, whom Jolson wanted to feature in his next show. The Shubert Brothers, his producers, said no. This is forgotten and ignored.      Perhaps as a result of this, perhaps not, but it remains that Al Jolson was the only white man allowed into Leroy’s, an all black nightclub in Harlem. This is no small honor      In the 1920’s, Garland Anderson, a porter who was a fledgling playwright, approached Jolson about a play he had written. He was a black man. Thanks to Jolson’s efforts on his behalf the piece became the first drama with an all-black cast ever produced on Broadway.      In 1919, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle were refused service in a Connecticut restaurant. Jolson heard about this and promptly tracked them down and told them that he would take them back there and he would “punch anyone who tried to stop us.” Blake and Sissle never forgot this and remained his friends for the rest of his life.      Al Jolson’s final resting place and memorial were designed by a prominent black architect.      Al Jolson also often spoke of his love of entertaining American armed forces and his record in his commitment to them is unsurpassed. Today, thanks largely to the visibility of the Bob Hope USO shows, we take the USO for granted. But there would be no USO had it not been for the tireless efforts and petitioning of the War Department by Al Jolson.

"Born May 19, 1933, Thomas Feelings is the son Samuel and Anna Nash Feelings.  He grew up in the ultra-urban Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York.  He began to draw at age four, copying pictures from newspaper comic strips into a book of blank papers sewn together by his mother.  He was just a little older when he heard about Thipadeaux, a black artist who was teaching at the Police Athletic Academy in his neighborhood.  The teacher suggested that, rather than copying from other’s people’s work, he try to draw some of the real people in his neighborhood.  He began with his mother and aunt.  He later went on to draw the adults and the wary, diffident children he saw around him.  He attended Cartoonist and Illustrator’s School in NY (1951-1953) and also School of Visual Arts in NY (1956-1960). 

By 1961 Feelings finished art school with an extensive portfolio.  He tried to obtain freelance assignments but was often told by editors that he was limiting his chances by concentrating solely on black subjects.  By the mid 1970’s Feelings had illustrated six books, including a volume of diary extracts collected by Julius Lester, called To Be A Slave.  Shortly thereafter, he was asked to do ten color illustrations for a new edition of Booker T. Washington’s autobiography, Up from Slavery.  Despite the tragic subject, Feelings found himself continually painting pictures in warm and radiant colors that were quite inappropriate to such a project.  Knowing these pictures would convey a falsely positive image of slavery; he cancelled the contract. 

If the 1970’s had been a time of new experiences, the 1980s found Feelings firmly grasping the themes that had been germinating within his work since his youth in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  His autobiography, Black Pilgrimage, records a conversation with an eight-year-old girl that probed unforgettable for the artist.  Feelings tried to explain to her that his drawings were of “pretty little black children, like you.”  The young girl expressed her refusal to see anything beautiful about the black children, replying, “Ain’t nothin’ black pretty.”  Feeling’s lifelong dedication to the beauty of African people and their descendants graphically illustrates his inability to accept such a hateful attitude. 

If any man should be regarded as the personification of the “black is beautiful” philosophy, that man is Thomas Feelings.  Feeling’s has been passionately committed to the mission of encouraging black children to understand their own spiritual and physical beauty.  By Co-naming Putman Ave. to “Tom Feelings Way”, he will be commemorated for remaining faithful to that mission for more than 40 years.

"Ahmad Samhan was a longtime resident and business entrepreneur of Fort Greene, Brooklyn. He was born in a small village in Palestine and later migrated to Brooklyn, New York in March 1973. He resided on Vanderbilt Ave between Myrtle and Park for over 30 years before starting a family of his own in his childhood home. Inspired by fellow Brooklyn residents, Ahmad was determined to be the true definition of an American-Arab pioneer. From the age of 13, he began to work so that he may provide additional income for his family. His earliest business ventures varied from delivering newspapers door-to-door in the neighborhood, to selling water bottles on the street, to washing car windows at the gas station formerly located on Vanderbilt Avenue, to working as a bag boy at the Met Food supermarket on Myrtle Avenue. Many people in the neighborhood recall his inviting smile and incredible sense of humor. Aside from his remarkable work ethic, he was known in the community for his impressive intellect.  As a student at Samuel J. Tilden high school, he was a member of the school band and played the French horn. After graduating high school in 1987, he obtained his baccalaureate at John Jay College in Criminal Justice. Although very fond of and well versed in criminology and justice, he found his niche as an entrepreneur instead. He went on to own over eight businesses in his lifetime, two of which were on Myrtle Avenue. Paying homage to his Palestinian roots, Ahmad opened his first restaurant ‘Zaytoons’ in Carroll Gardens in 1995. Following the immediate success of that location, Ahmad was able to open a second location in his own backyard on Myrtle Avenue. Of all his businesses across Brooklyn, this location was always Ahmad’s favorite.   However, as the neighborhood began to transform, Ahmad realized he too would have to adapt to the evolving neighborhood. After 15 years of serving the community Middle Eastern food, Ahmad converted Zaytoons into a taqueria in 2017. Villa Pancho would eventually close after his untimely passing in 2020. The neighborhood not only enjoyed his cuisines, they were acquainted with his exuberant personality. Ahmad was known for stopping anyone and talking to them. The bench in front of his business has encountered a multitude of conversations varying from common street banter to the deep and thought-provoking conversations that many people in the community expressed their gratitude for after his passing. Indifferent of age, religion, politics, race or beliefs, Ahmad always found a way to connect to the people he would converse with. He left an incredible impression on those who knew him. He was an extraordinary man who could relate to anyone who interacted with him. He was best described as a wealth of knowledge, always able to relate and understand anyone he happened upon. He spent many days sitting on the bench in front of his restaurant talking to his neighbors and bringing joy to their lives as they brought joy to his. He cared for the community that contributed to his upbringing and constantly reminded everyone around him to always give back to their local communities as it is what shapes the future generations. He spent his life in service to his community, from his lunch donations to Brooklyn Hospital and SUNY Downstate Hospital in appreciation of our healthcare heroes on the frontlines of the pandemic to his annual dinners, made by him personally, in Ramadan at the local mosque on Fulton Street.

It was under his leadership that Trinity  undertook the task of building and completing a new church and multi-purpose fellowship hall to meet its increased needs. 

One of the hallmarks of Pastor Tyler-Lloyd’s ministry was his concern and commitment to missions.  This concern was evident when he was elected president of the Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention from 1985 to 1989.

"Joseph Calabria was drafted into the United States and served in the Korean War.  His career, after being discharged from the military, was spent on the Manhattan waterfront initially as a Longshoreman where his performance resulted in his promotion to Forman, Pier Supervision and finally, Hiring Boss. He served as a Union Delegate for Local 856 of the International Longshoremen’s Association for several years. Over the years he was affectionately referred to as the “Mayor of Barlow Avenue” by his friends and neighbors. He was the neighborhood “Go-to Guy.” He was always willing to help out neighbors and friends with advice, labor and or lending a tool for working around the house, repairing a car or any other task. He could always be counted on to help the kids in the neighborhood by fixing their bikes and putting air in their tires, footballs or basketballs. He had a nickname for many of the kids and loved to joke around with them. The kids loved to hear his stories and struggled to decipher the analogies for which he was famous throughout the neighborhood.  He was a family man who loved working on his cars and taking care of his home and enjoyed sitting on the porch and reinforcing the many relationships he formed with the neighbors as they passed by just saying hello.  In the 1990’s he became active with the Cpl A.F. Kivlehan Chapter of the Korean War Veterans. After his retirement from the waterfront he devoted all of his efforts to working with the Chapter and was its Commanding officer for 18 years.  During his tenure he was instrumental in the renaming of the Richmond Parkway to the Korean War Veterans Parkway and in the renaming of the PS 6 School to the Allan F. Kivlehan School. He also helped to establish the Korean Veterans Memorial on Ocean Terrace and the Allan F. Kivlehan Park in New Dorp. He often visited Staten Island schools to speak with students about the Korean War. He would say, “If you like your freedom, thank a vet,” which became a tagline for him.

"Founded in 1916, Plaza College first began as an independent institution based in Long Island City.  As long-range plans indicated a need for more space, the college moved to 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights in 1970.  With additional accommodations available, the College has continued to develop and build an outstanding learning environment for its students.  Academic support, counseling, and placement services reach out to each student, ensuring a successful educational experience.  The development of computer facilities, course offerings, and other enhancements to the life of the college community clearly reflects the college’s history of responding to dramatic changes in technology and the nature of business.   

From a historical perspective, notable Plaza College events include the development of its two-year programs - 1975; authorization by the Board of Regents of the State of New York to confer the degree of Associate in Occupational Studies (A.O.S.) - 1982; authorization to confer the degree of Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) - 1988; Middle States Candidacy – 1997.  The college was accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools on March 6, 2002. 

The 1990’s continued to be a period of extensive development for the College.  With completion of Bruson Hall, the size of the College nearly doubled.  This made possible an expanded library, internet facility, Learning Resource Center, additional computer classrooms, student lounge, and special events hall.  These additions have made the learning environment at Plaza College a special place to be.  Efforts also proceeded in developing “The Computer Business Support Specialist,” a new degree program of study, designed to offer students an intense focus on computer software, hardware and network operations. 

To meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, the college is committed to achieving strategic planning goals and building upon its strengths through the outcomes assessment process.

"Jack Fitzgerald was born on March 10, 1922, on Beach 106th Street in Rockaway, Queens to John Fitzgerald and Anne Foley of Limerick, Ireland.  His hard-working parents had come from Ireland looking for a better life and settled in Rockaway to raise their family. 

Jack attended St. Francis DeSales in Belle Harbor, and Bishop Loughlin High School in Brooklyn.  He then attended Manhattan College in the Bronx and moved on to the Academy of Aeronautics, across from LaGuardia Airport.

After the War, he married Ellen Hancock in November of 1947, and soon after purchased Fitzgerald’s Hotel on Beach 108th Street and Shore Front Parkway in Rockaway.  He served as a member of the Chamber of Commerce and a President of the Rockaway Rotary Club.  He loved serving his community and taught this dedication to his four children.

"Raoul Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who risked his life to save Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust.  A descendant of a long line of Swedish bankers and diplomats, Wallenberg was an architect.  In 1936, he spent six months in Haifa where he studied management at the Holland Bank and first met with Jewish refugees from Germany.  He returned to Stockholm and worked for a central European trading company whose president was a Hungarian Jew.  Wallenberg’s chief operation was the distribution of Swedish certificates of protection, commonly known as “Wallenberg passports,” which the Swedish government granted to any Jew who had some tie with Sweden.  Applying pressure on the Hungarian government, Wallenberg recruited thousands of Jews for his work.  He initiated the establishment of an “international ghetto,” this vehicle allowed 33,000 Hungarian Jews to find sanctuary and thus liberation in neutral countries.  In November, 1944, the remaining members of the Jewish community in Budapest were forced on a death march to the Austrian border with Hungary.  Wallenberg and other Swedish staffers followed the column in trucks, distributing medicine, food and clothing.  He was able to save 500 of the marchers and returned them to Budapest.  In Budapest, he organized an official Swedish labor detachment and a “Jewish Guard,” consisting of Aryan-looking Jews dressed in S.S. uniforms.  He built and funded Jewish hospitals and soup kitchens.  He was not only interested in the personal safety of Hungarian Jews, but in the liberation of Hungary and plans to restore the Hungarian economy.

"Henry “Red” Allen was a trumpeter of great significance with his use of long, flowing melodic lines.  He made his first recordings with Clarence Johnson while on tour with the struggling King Oliver Dixie Syncopators in 1927.  He spent a lot of time playing on riverboats traveling the Mississippi and made several recordings under his own name in 1929 for Victor and then joined the Luis Russel Orchestra.  He worked with the great tenor soloist Coleman Hawkins while in the Fletcher Henderson big band in 1933 and 1934 and many of his improvised solos were written in as part of arrangements by Henderson.  In 1934 and 1935, he made a number of recordings which were issued under his own name on the Vocalion, Parlophone, and Banner labels.  His solos on sides like Truckin' and Down South Camp Meeting are among his finest on record.  He was also a member of a swinging studio all-star type band organized by songwriter, publisher and booking agent Irving Mills.  He recorded with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band from 1934 to 1936 which waxed some fantastic sides on Columbia and its subsidiary Vocalion.  He established himself as a premier soloist of the early swing period with many of the recordings done in the aforementioned settings in the early and mid-1930s.  In 1937, he rejoined the Luis Russel big band which was fronted by Louis Armstrong.  He later reinvented himself forming a sextet of his own which achieved great popularity in New York at clubs like Kelly’s Stable and Café Society.  This group, with occasional personnel changes, remained together until the early 1950’s.  His trumpet and vocals can be heard on swinging jazz and quasi R&B sides from the mid-1940s such as “Get The Mop,” “The Theme,” and “Ride Red Ride.”  From April 1954, he was a member of a Dixieland style house band at the Metropole in NYC.  In 1957, he was seen in the film “The Sound Of Jazz” and in the fall of 1959, he toured Europe as a sideman with Kid Ory.  In the early sixties, he continued to play at the Metropole and other NYC jazz clubs and made occasional trips to Boston and Chicago.  He continued to stay active in the mid-1960s but was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer late in 1966.  He embarked on a tour of Great Britain returning back to the U.S. just six weeks before his death.

"Manhattan's V.A. hospital, a 166-bed center affiliated with the New York University Medical Center and the home of all the administration's cardiac and neurosurgical care in the greater metropolitan region, is regarded by medical experts as a star in the nation's constellation of veterans' hospitals.  

The Veterans Hospital, ideally located 21st Street and First Avenue, is geographically key to thousands of veterans. Currently the facility is able to exchange information, research, technology and have access to exceptional hospitals in Manhattan including; NYU and Bellevue Medical Centers, Beth Israel Medical Center, the Mount Sinai Medical Center, and the New York Weill Cornell Medical Center. The Manhattan Veterans Hospital facility has also been at the forefront of clinical care and research for veterans with HIV/AIDS since the 1980’s, and is the only VA facility to house both a designated clinical care unit and Research Center for AIDS and HIV Infection. 

Over 30,000 veterans who use the hospital, at East 23rd Street and First Avenue, should not worry, federal officials say, because there is no plan - not yet, anyway - to close it.

"Austin Jacobo was born on a sugar cane plantation in the Dominican Republic on January 5, 1929. He learned very early to fight for his rights and the rights of others. His community work began in Consuelo, Dominican Republic in 1951 helping the Catholic Church develop and organize the community. He  was involved in improving housing conditions, and providing family, sports and youth leadership programs. In 1966 he became a scout for the Houston Astros major league baseball team. ‘Jacobo’ as he was affectionately called, had to escape the Dominican Republic because of his involvement as a union organizer. He had to flee his country unexpectedly and leave his family behind. The government considered him a communist because he believed in the rights of people. He spoke against the government and organized the people in protests and job actions. He did not stand down to the government even thought it almost cost him his life. The Catholic Church helped him escape to Canada and later he immigrated to the United States. 

He came to the United States in 1970. Although he did not speak the language as well as the people in the community, the strength of his convictions prompted him to get involved with the people in his community almost immediately. He began by getting involved with sports via youth programs. He worked as a janitor for Saint Martin of Tours, a local Catholic Church that he asked to allow him to open the gymnasium to create a place where young people could go and play in order to be out of the streets. He was the president of the Crotona Community Coalition for 25 years. Under his leadership, the community was transformed. As a visionary leader, he believed that the family unit is the center of the community. Jacobo understood hat nurturing the family and its needs would have a positive impact on decreasing crime and violence in the community. Housing was a big issue. He first began to fight for rent control, heating of the buildings, and renovation of the apartments. Next, Jacobo redoubled his efforts to find places and activities to involve the youth, keep them away from drugs. As he expanded his vision, he and his staff had to explore external community organizations and people that would help them obtain their goals. The Coalition reached out to politicians, private and public industries and any one else who benefits from the community. Through his leadership and that of the Crotona Community Coalition, the community received a 3 million dollar grant from Mayor Koch and the organization was able to build its first ballpark and maintain a sports program. Through the years the community has built two more parks with additional grants obtained by the coalition under Jacobo's leadership. The Crotona Community Coalition also began to buy buildings and build affordable housing. One of his big dreams for the community was to build a community center. He was able to help create the community center called the Mary Mitchell Center, which has been open since 1998. This Center is the epitome of Jacobo's primary goal of keeping the youth off the streets and away from drugs. 

Jacobo always wore a green baseball cap, which become a symbol of his mission. As an authentic leader he had “the integrity to walk the talk and talk the walk, self-awareness of his feelings and actions, sensitivity and empathy toward and in relationship to the community”. Austin Jacobo died on March 20, 2002. He was survived by his wife, Altagracia; three daughters, Anna, Amerelis and Astrid, all of The Bronx; a son, Astin Jr., of The Bronx; and three grandchildren.

"The following biographical material was provided by the Rodriguez family. 

Robert Rodriguez was born in East Harlem on August 1, 1951. He was the third of seven children born to Juan and Carmen Rodriguez. Robert attended Public School 72 and Junior High School 13, in East Harlem, before graduating from Alfred E. Smith High School in 1969. After High School, Robert attended Nyack Missionary College. Soon after college, he met and fell in love with Edith Delerme and they were married on June 9, 1974. The marriage produced two sons, Robert Jay, and Jonathan Ray, and one daughter, Tina Rasheen. 

During the early  70’s Robert served as Manpower Director for the East Harlem Community Corporation. In this capacity he was able to find employment for hundreds of workers. Because he believed that access to jobs determines the quality of our lives, he drew great satisfaction from his role in employee placement. Early on, Robert Rodriguez became very active in the civic life of his community. He was elected to the Board of Community School District #4, in 1973 and again in 1982, serving for a time as its president. During this period he was directly responsible for the initiation of many after school programs for young people at junior high school 45. He was a member of the Advisory Board of Metropolitan Hospital from 1973 until 1977.

In 1976, Robert Rodriguez was elected to represent the 8th Councilmanic District of the City of New York. His constituency included the South Bronx, portions of the Upper East Side and East Harlem. At the time of his election, Robert was the youngest person ever elected to the Council. He was elected a second time in 1980 and served until 1982 before leaving to serve as Director of Labor Relations at the New York City Fire Department. In 1978, while still at the Council, Robert founded the East Harlem Multiservice Center (EHMC) on 120th Street between First Avenue and Pleasant Avenue. He was especially proud of this achievement and EHMC remains a cornerstore of the East Harlem community helping thousands of families each year. 

Robert Rodriguez left the Fire Department in 1984 and was Vice-President of Marketing and Development for Delgado-Huegel Architects for two years before becoming chief of staff for Assemblyman Jose Serrano. He later served as Vice President for Operations and Public Affairs for SCS Business Technical Institute and was a Special Projects Director for the New York State Hispanic Housing and Economic Development Task Force.

"Juan María Díaz was born in Montecristi, Dominican Republic, on a cattle ranch owned by his parents. He was thirteen years old when the United States Occupation Forces arrived in Montecristi in 1916. Although he was too young to understand the circumstances of the occupation, he was very impressed with the efficiency and speed with which the Occupation Forces restored essential services and brought food and water, which had been in short supply. Despite his youth, he was very self-confident and a born leader. He immediately offered his services as an interpreter to the Occupation Forces in Montecristi. The commanding officers of the Occupation Forces in Montecristi were very impressed with his energy and outgoing personality. Over the months, the officers encouraged Juan María to emigrate to the United States, where they believed he could have a more promising future. They helped him with the immigration process, and he arrived in New York City on August 22, 1923, when he was 19 years old. When Rafael Leonidas Trujillo came to power, Juan María Díaz early on became very active in anti-Trujillo activities and got involved in the Dominican exiles’ effort against the Trujillo’s regime. Juan María never returned to the Dominican Republic while dictator Trujillo and his family ruled the country for more than 30 years. During this time, he was unable to communicate with his family and some of his brothers were jailed by Trujillo. Díaz received many death threats over those years. There were very few Dominicans in New York City when Juan María Díaz arrived in 1923. Furthermore, he didn’t know any Dominicans who may have lived in the city at that time. However, he met his future wife, María Luisa Sosa, in New York City in 1925 and they were married and later had two children. His wife died in May of 1930 and he was left with two small children. A few years later he remarried and had another child. Fortunately, Juan María Díaz was well prepared and spoke English which helped him secure a position with the New York City Transit System where he remained employed until he retired. During his employment with the Transit System, he made great strides as a union organizer and civic leader, as well as an active member of the Democratic Party in New York City. His political affiliations in New York City included senior elected officials and union leaders. Juan María Díaz was also instrumental in securing support for the anti-Trujillo opposition from various members of the United States Congress, including Senator J. William Fulbright, then Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and various Latin American Presidents and leaders. During Trujillo’s rule, Díaz was often quoted in the media and interviewed on television on issues concerning the Dominican Republic and the opposition to Trujillo. In 1930, Díaz established a fraternal organization of Dominicans living in New York City, and Dominican exiles in other countries, to organize support for the overthrow of Trujillo’s dictatorship and establish democracy in the Dominican Republic. From the 1930s to the start of WWII, there were many persons in New York City who needed basic subsistence. During this period, Díaz was known as a kind and generous man who always helped those who were less fortunate than he. Juan María Díaz became an American Citizen on May 15, 1940. During WWII, he was not called to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States because he had three small children. However, he served in the National Guard and as a Block Warden, patrolling the streets each evening to ensure that all residents maintained their windows covered to ensure that apartment lights would not be visible by enemy airplanes in the night sky. In 1941, the US chapter of the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD) was founded in Díaz’s home in New York City and he was elected head of the PRD in New York. Together with other PRD’s political leaders (Angel Miolán, Juan Bosch, Juan Isidro Jiménes Grullón), Díaz worked tirelessly to organize Dominican exiles, as well as political support from US government and politicians against Trujillo’s regime. He worked with the PRD for some years, but later left the party and became engaged with other Dominican exiles groups in the US and abroad. As the number of Dominicans increased in New York and in other countries in Latin America, anti-Trujillo groups and political parties in the US and abroad worked to secure the overthrow of the Trujillo dictatorship. Juan María Díaz took active participation in many of those efforts. From 1934 to 1959 these groups led several failed anti-Trujillo military expeditions to free the Dominican Republic from Trujillo’s dictatorship. In October 1952, Mr. Andres Requena, Díaz’ close friend and copublisher of an anti-Trujillo newspaper, Patria, was assassinated in New York City by Trujillo’s agents. As a result of many assassination threats over the years, he was assigned 24-hour protection by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). His involvement in the Dominican exile movement was instrumental in galvanizing international support for against Trujillo’s dictator ship and for creating the conditions for democracy to flourish in the Dominican Republic. Juan María Díaz’ active involvement in the political activities of the Dominican Republic ended in 1963, his 60th birthday. However, he continued to follow the country’s progress for many years. He died in New York. ",Manhattan,Street,1657382400000.0,Abreu,Between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue ,Juan M. Díaz Way ,West 157th Street ,10032.0,1704.0,Int.

"Located at 570 Crown St, the United Lubavitcher Yeshiva, also known as Tomchei Temimim, occupies most of Albany Avenue and is recognizable as the ""red brick building with tinted windows"" in the center of Crown Heights. Established in 1897 in Russia by Rabbi Shalom DovBer, the fifth Chabad Rebbe, the yeshiva survived through various upheavals and wars, relocating to Warsaw and later Otwock, Poland, and finally to Shanghai, China during World War II. The previous Lubavitcher Rabbi founded Tomchei Temimim of America in 1940, immediately upon arriving in America, having just escaped war-torn Europe. He encouraged the continuation of Jewish life, traditions and culture in America, and the roots of the school that were planted on that day bore fruits that helped rebuild the broken Jewish community shattered by the Holocaust. In 1988, the grand Lubavitcher Rebbe called for the construction of more housing and cultural, educational, and community facilities, which led to the construction of the iconic 570 Crown Street building, which opened in 1992. For over thirty years, this building has serviced tens of thousands of children in our community. It has hosted thousands of community events including bar mitzvahs, engagements, community awareness programs, conventions and much more. Recently, during the COVID 19 pandemic, when the building was not able to service the children we retrofitted the school to be a rehabilitation center for the many people recovering from the pandemic. Currently, the facility is adding an additional 21,000 square feet to include more classrooms, resource rooms, mental health offices, staff lounges, a recreation room, a new synagogue and gym.

"Rev. Tañon was born in Comerio, Puerto Rico on January 10, 1904. He came to New York City in 1929 and was converted in a street service in Harlem in 1934, under the preaching of the Mexican pastor, Rev. Eleuterio Paz. With the untiring support of his wife, Filomena, he responded to God's call to ministry. He served as an Assistant Pastor for several years and then in 1943 accepted the pastorate of a “store front” mission with 12 members—“Iglesia Cristiana Juan 3:16”. The struggles and triumphs of Rev. Tañon in developing this “store-front” church in the Bronx amidst poverty, prejudice, institutional racism, and Anglo Protestant apathy is documented well in his biography (Ramon Sanchez, Ricardo Tañon: El Poder y la Gloria de Dios, San Juan, Puerto Rico: Romualdo Real, 1980). 

During the 34 year pastorate of Rev. Tañon at “Juan 3:16”, 17 new churches were planted throughout the Northeast, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic; 54 pastors nurtured at ""Juan 3:16"" and sent out all over the Spanish-speaking world; hundreds trained at the Bible Institutes; one year alone 12 full-time Bible School students were mobilized and fully supported by the church. The church grew and developed a Sunday School with an average attendance of over 1,500 (with a staff of 120), over 1,000 attending every Sunday night worship service and at baptismal and evangelistic services 2,000 would “jam” the church. At one time it had the largest Hispanic Christian bookstore in the Northeast, whose profit at one point helped support 20 missionaries in foreign fields; a church library for its members and a print shop (which also produced thousands of Gospel tracts a year for distribution). It had several evangelistic teams and prison ministry teams, several standing Benevolent Programs, and provided the inspiration and leadership for a social service agency in the church's premises serving the church and community at large. At his official retirement on June 28, 1977, the “Iglesia Cristiana Juan 3:16” was the largest Hispanic church in the USA.

"Nicholas Polonski was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 24, 1916 and was a life-long community leader in the Northside area. He went to work early and was only 14 when he became a warehouseman at the Morel meat packing warehouse at North 10th Street and Kent Avenue. He enlisted in the Army in 1937, and when his tour of duty was over in 1940 he went back to warehouse work. However, the United States entered World War II a year later and he was back in uniform again as a Combat Engineer. Nicholas was awarded the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action for risking his life to carry several officers to safety when they were thrown from a bridge that was being shelled. 

Returning to the Northside after the war, Nick briefly went back to warehouse work, passed the test for the Sanitation Department, and worked there for 30 years. He was honored for his valor at Sanitation also after he pulled a police officer from the flaming wreckage of his motorcycle. 

After returning from the service, Nick married his one and only love, Teresa, and they had a wonderful daughter. The love and support of his family gave Nick the strength to fight for his community. On his own time, Nick began helping community people get the things they needed to survive. He was the troubleshooter, complaints bureau and ombudsman for everything that touched people’s lives. In the early, years he would take people to the political clubhouse to get help there. Later on, he developed contacts directly to governmental offices and programs, although he never forgot the importance of political strength. Nick connected people and neighborhood institutions to the programs and services they needed. 

As vital as his help was to many people, Nick made his mark through larger issues. He led the fight against S&S Corrugated Paper Machinery when the City condemned 92 apartments to prevent S&S from moving its jobs elsewhere. Although the neighborhood fought to the last, many residents were dragged out of their homes while the bulldozers waited on the sidewalks, the houses were destroyed. In spite of this defeat, Nick and other community people had come together to form the Northside Community Development Council to fight for replacement housing, a senior citizens center and to make sure that nothing so destructive would ever again tear apart their neighborhood. Thirty years later, the Northside Community Development Council is still working to improve the environment. The Northside Senior Center is still providing services to our long-time neighbors. The homes on North 3rd Street and 4th Street are still strengthening the neighborhood. 

Nicholas Polonski died on April 20, 1999. He left behind a neighborhood far stronger that the neighborhood he was born into, and he left many friends who still miss him very much, still wish they could see him walking along Bedford or Driggs so they could thank him for everything he did and maybe do something for him.

"Ruth Logan attended primary and elementary school in Tuskegee, was later sent to Ohio's Oberlin College for two years of college preparatory work, followed by a three-year education at Boston's Sargent College, from which she graduated in 1913. After her graduation, she returned to teach physical education at Tuskegee Institute. In 1917, in Tuskegee Institute's chapel, she married Eugene Percy Roberts, a widowed doctor who was New York City's second black licensed physician and started his practice in 1894. Ruth and her husband moved into a large, elegant town house in Harlem, widely known simply as ""130"". The full address was 130 West 130th Street. In conjunction with her mother, Ruth Logan organized suffrage events at Tuskegee Institute in 1913, and after her marriage, became active in Republican Party affairs in New York. Once settled in New York City, she established her home as one of the Harlem Renaissance's leading social, artistic, and political salons. She volunteered on behalf of improved care for those suffering from tuberculosis, worked with a home for unwed mothers, supported local arts initiatives, and served on several NAACP and YWCA boards. She especially toiled on behalf of gaining opportunities for African American graduate nurses in the face of blatant racial and gender discrimination. During World War II, she used her persuasive skills and political connections to work on their behalf, by lobbying Ohio's Rep.

"Rafael A. Estevez was a genuine activist, a pioneer, a special human being focused on the progress of Dominicans in the United States. He was born in the city of Santiago in the Dominican Republic and was compassionate with a strong desire and passion to help anyone he could, particularly the less privileged and disadvantaged in his community. A hard-working construction worker, he worked to provide for his family and gave extra money he earned to assist the less privileged. His passion led him to co-found the organization Corazones Unidos based in the Dominican Republic. This organization provided help for those without families and those with heart disease. He initially supported the organization with his own funds and even opened his home for the organization until he and the co-founders were able to mobilize enough interest and support from other sources to sustain the organization. The organization is now one of the best heart surgery hospitals in the Dominican Republic. He migrated to the United States in the late 1970’s, to Manhattan, and immediately resumed his community service. He was one of the founders of the Dominican Children’s Aid Committee, where he remained active for years as an advisor, was one of the founders of the Corazones Unidos in New York and chaired the Dominican Parade Organizing Committee establishing, with others, The Dominican Day Parade in 1982. As a founding father, he became the president of the parade in 1989. Prior to his election, the parade was held in Washington Heights. Under his tenor as president, he fought and successfully moved the parade to the Avenue of the Americas providing the most visible symbol of the city's largest immigrant group. He received many awards and plaques acknowledging his contributions and was a major participant with Yeshiva University in the effort to re-designate portion of Amsterdam Avenue as a park for students and the community. He was also very active in education in his community. To ensure that Elementary School P.S. 132 continued to provide the best quality education to the community, he was active in organizing the School's Parents' Association and later served as the president of the association. He was also responsible for designating and renaming the school as Juan Pablo Duarte, after one of the Dominican Republic founding fathers.

"Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar Ambedkar was born into the “untouchable” caste of Mahars in the Indian state of Maharashtra. They traditionally performed jobs considered “unclean” by Hindu theology: a religious and economic catch-22 in which they were ritually unclean because of the work they did and could only do certain types of work because they were ritually unclean. They were not allowed to enter Hindu temples–in some regions they couldn’t even walk on the road in front of a temple. In the South Indian state of Travancore, untouchables had to carry a bell that announced their presence so higher caste Hindus would not be defiled by their proximity. Like African-American reformer Frederick Douglas, Ambedkar became a spokesman for an oppressed people thanks to education. At a time when fewer than one percent of his caste could read, Ambedkar was supported in his quest for education by both his family and high caste Hindu reformers who recognized his talents. Between 1912 and 1923, he earned a BA in Bombay, an MA and PhD in economics from Columbia University, and a MA and D.Sci in economics from London University–and passed the bar from Grey’s Inn in London. Back in India, Ambedkar devoted himself to improving the lives of untouchables. He soon found himself in conflict with Gandhi, who had declared himself an untouchable by choice. They disagreed at both the symbolic and the practical level. Both men recognized the power of abandoning the term “untouchable”. Gandhi proposed Harijans (people of God) as a substitute. Ambedkar rejected Harijan as patronizing, preferring the term dalit (oppressed). Gandhi wanted to improve the lives of Untouchables by appealing to caste Hindus to abandon untouchability. Ambedkar recognized that it was easier to change laws than to change people’s hearts and heads. He preferred to lead dalits in campaigns designed to improve access to education and to secure basic civil and religious rights, including the right to use the public water system and to enter temples. In 1935, after an unsuccessful five-year campaign to gain the right to enter Hindu temples, Ambedkar decided if you can’t beat them, leave them. He declared “I was born a Hindu, but I will not die a Hindu” He urged untouchables to “change your religion”: reject Hinduism and convert to a religion that doesn’t recognize caste or untouchabliity. Both Christianity and Buddhism fit the description, but Ambedkar leaned toward Buddhism, which had ceased to be a living religion in India when Muslim invaders destroyed its temples and monasteries in the twelfth century, On October 4, 1956, after twenty years of study and writing on the subject, Ambedkar and thousands of other dalits converted to Buddhism in a massive ceremony. In the following years, more than four million dalits declared themselves Buddhists and stepped outside the mental framework of the caste system. Ambedkar fought bitterly with Gandhi and the Indian National Congress on issues of dalit rights and representation throughout the 1930s and 1940s. But when India achieved independence, Nehru named Ambedkar India’s first Minister of Law. More important for the position of dalits in independent India, the new nation’s temporary assembly elected Ambedkar chairman of the committee that drafted its constitution. Under his leadership, the constitution legally abolished untouchability and included safeguards for depressed minorities. Since independence, India has implemented affirmative action programs for the benefit of what are officially called the “Scheduled Castes and Tribes”. In 1997, fifty years after independence, India elected its first dalit president–an event what would have been unthinkable during Ambedkar’s lifetime. Nonetheless, dalits still suffer from discrimination on many fronts. He is celebrated in India and all over the world annually on April 14, his birthday.

She has also performed in several films and Broadway shows.  In 1940, when she and her husband were featured on the NBC radio program, “Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm”, they became the first African-American jazz stars to have their own weekly radio series.  In 1957, she took a break from her singing career and devoted time to her community.  She became a nurse at the local school board and, in 1970, founded a non-profit educational organization called, “The House that Jazz Built”.  This organization offered space to musicians and local art groups and provided musical training for children, workshops and concerts. This was particularly important for the community as it was established during a time of great difficulty and disinvestment in the neighborhood of Morissania.  She eventually resumed her musical career, receiving a Tony award nomination for her performance in the musical, “My Old Friends” in 1979 and three Gammy Award nominations in the 1980s.

8.	Develop a training video for officers involved in undercover operations which includes the perspectives of community leaders from the areas where operations are most often undertaken  

9.	Require tactical plans for undercover operations to include relevant information about the neighborhood in which the operation will take place  

10.	Require the administration of a Breathalyzer test in all cases in which a member of the service is involved in a firearms discharge incident, on duty or off duty, which results in injury or death  

11.	Clarify Department procedures regarding the consumption of alcohol by undercover officers during operations to limit such consumption to two drinks per tour and provide training on credible ways to avoid drinking altogether when pressured to do so by subjects

"The following biographical information was provided by the Candrilli family.
Salvatore “Sal” Candrilli was born on May 30, 1923 to Jerome and Theresa 
Candrilli. He was raised in the Dongan Hills section of Staten Island, attended Public 
School 11 and graduated from New Dorp High School in 1942. As a child, Mr. Candrilli 
was always active in sports, playing baseball for New Dorp High School, football in the 
New Dorp Teens Football League and caddying at the Richmond County Country Club, 
which brought out his love for golf. 
On October 22, 1942 Sal Candrilli enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and 
served as a Combat Engineer in the 2nd Division, seeing action in Spain, the Mariana 
Islands and Okinawa. He was honorably discharged as a Corporal on December 8, 1945. 
After his discharge, Sal Candrilli worked for the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company 
4
and for Local 21, Staten Island before being hired by the New York City Department of 
Parks, where he retired after 35 years as a Mechanic Foreman in 1985.
He met and married, Ethel Young on April 10, 1948 and they had four children, 
Donald, Richard, Jerome and Missey, which is why his “love affair” of approximately 30 
years, with Little League Baseball started. Sal Candrilli began his Little League “career” 
as a coach with the Island Chevies. He also served as field Commissioner, umpire, and 
later, president of the Staten Island Little League in Dongan Hills, for approximately 17 
years. He continued for another 13 years as District 24 Administrator for the National 
Little League Headquarters, overseeing leagues on Staten Island and in Manhattan. 
During this time he led the fight against a measure that would have taxed Little Leagues 
for their real estate helping to form the Staten Island Athletic and Recreational Alliance. 
He also was a pioneer in creating night baseball on Staten Island and a girl’s softball 
program. A ball field was named for him by the Staten Island Little League. 
In May of 1973, the Award of Merit was presented to Mr. Candrilli from then 
Borough President of Richmond, Robert T. Connor. In 1974, while president of the 
Staten Island Little League, he was profiled in the Staten Island Advance for his work in 
planning and preparing to host the National Regional Tournament at Hy Turkin field. In 
1976, he was honored for “Outstanding Services to Staten Island Sports”, at the 11th
annual Advance All-Star Dinner. In 1985 Mr. Candrilli decided to “retire” from Little 
League Baseball because, as he said, “times have changed and it’s time for someone else 
to take over”, but also saying that, “I’ll always be around”.
On September 20, 1996 Salvatore Candrilli died. He was survived by his wife, the 
former Ethel Young; his children, a sister, Ann Pinto, and four grandchildren. His 
participation in organized sports on Staten Island made a difference for many people, 
5
including his grandchildren, Christina and Peter Candrilli and Nicole and Jennifer 
Vitagliano, who actively play in many organized sports on Staten Island. They have 
inherited his sportsmanship, respect for others on and off the field, and his true feelings 
for all kinds of sports, always remembering that he would say “it doesn’t make a 
difference if you win or lose but it’s how you play the game”. It is therefore fitting that

"Jean-Jacques Dessalines is one of the founding fathers of Haiti, having taken charge of the Haitian Revolution to victory in defeating the French Napoleon Army in 1804.  Significant to world history, the Haitian Revolution is not only the first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas, but also resulted in Haiti being the first Latin American country and second in the Western Hemisphere to declare its independence, after the United States declared independence from Britain in 1776.   Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution was inspirational and gave support to the enslaved and subjugated peoples throughout the world.  More significantly, the Haitian Revolution was a truly transcultural event, joining three interlocking and intersectional 18th Century struggles, which continue to reverberate to the present:  the challenge to imperial European authority; the fight for racial equality and the movement to end to slavery.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, he joined the fight for freedom when thousands of brutally exploited enslaved people rose up against their colonial masters, and their enablers in France, who murdered and massacred hundreds of thousands of people across the Caribbean.  By 1793, he was fighting under General Toussaint Louverture, earning the nickname “the Tiger” for his intensity in battle and his military skill. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794.  From 1794 through 1802, Dessalines fought with Louverture both for and against France for the eradication of slavery and the self-determination of the people of Saint-Domingue.   

After Louverture was kidnapped, shackled and deported to France in 1802, Dessalines led the Revolution, as Napoleon appointed General Rochambeau to lead the French military expedition to re-conquer Saint-Domingue.  Rochambeau immediately embarked on a massacre of much of the non-white civilians, including women and children, and military population by staging mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning.  By January 1, 1804, the French were defeated and Dessalines declared Haiti independent. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines, in response to French brutality and out of fear of future French re-conquest and re-enslavement ordered the execution of all the remaining white French on the island, estimated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000, but personally protected whites loyal to Haitian independence, including thousands of Polish soldiers who had defected from the French Army. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) became the first slave revolt in modern history to result in an independent nation. 

The independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States, and encouraged republican revolutions in Latin America, and eventually Africa.  Under Petion, Haiti provided direct assistance to Simon Bolivar on at least two crucial occasions during the latter’s successful efforts to secure independence for the Spanish Colonial territories throughout Latin America.  Dessalines was declared Emperor of Haiti in September 1804. Many of the policies he implemented were progressive even by today’s standards, including social policies, such as freedom of religion, equal rights for children born out of wedlock, marriage and divorce laws favorable to women.  Dessalines also attempted land reforms, and specifically policies to address the concentration of ownership of valuable plantations throughout the country by a few wealthy families, which likely led to his death in a roadside ambush on October 17, 1806, when those who opposed his economic policies rebelled and took up arms against him.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines remains a popular symbol of Haitian nationalism. The first capital of independent Haiti was renamed “Dessalines”; the national anthem of Haiti is named after him (“La Dessalinienne”); and his image appears on the 250 Haitian gourde note.

"Angelo Del Toro was born in East Harlem, on April 16, 1947, to Virginia and Dionesio Del Toro.  He attended local schools, graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, Manhattan Community College, City College of New York (Bachelor of Arts Degree) and New York University Law School.  In 1974, at the age of twenty-seven, Angelo was elected to the New York State Assembly where he represented his East Harlem community for the next twenty years. 

In his twenty years of service to his community and state Angelo Del Toro played a vital role in the advancement of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Caucus and in the formation of the Puerto Rican Legislative Task Force, two organizations dedicated to the protection of Latino and African American rights and interests in New York State.  He also served as chairman of the Assembly's Social Service Committee, and later its Education Committee.  He was also instrumental in securing funding which led to the creation of Hostos Community College in the Bronx, the renovation of Boricua College in Manhattan and the establishment of Touro College in  East Harlem.  For his work on behalf of the Puerto Rican Youth Leadership Institute, Angelo received special recognition from ASPIRA of New York.   

Upon Angelo's death the institute was renamed the “Angelo Del Toro Puerto Rican/Hispanic Youth Leadership Institute” in his honor.  For his longtime advocacy on behalf of women's rights “Votes for Choice,” a political action organization, presented Angelo with its prestigious Gloria Steinem Award. 

Angelo Del Toro's favorite constituents were the senior citizens of his community.  Each year, during his terms in office, he organized a trip to Albany for some two thousands of senior citizens from East Harlem.  This event, called “Senior Citizen Day in Albany,” enabled the seniors to meet face to face with their elected representatives, to testify before a special session of the state legislature and call attention to the needs of the elderly.  One of Angelo's most significant achievements on behalf of senior citizens was his tireless determination in coordinating the funding process for the construction of the “Virginia Del Toro House” at 128 East 112th Street in East Harlem.  This facility, which bears his mother’s name, opened in 1994 and currently houses 50 poor senior citizens who live in comfort and dignity, because of Angelo Del Toro.  Angelo Del Toro died on December 30, 1994, and was survived by his brother, William Del Toro.

"Between 1893 and 1910, this section of West 28th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway became known as Tin Pan Alley, often cited as the birthplace of American popular music for making sheet music available to countless American households. Here, composers, arrangers, lyricists, performers, and printers came together as collaborative firms and revolutionized the music industry's practices for the production and promotion of popular music. Such iconic songs as ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" and ""God Bless America"" were published on 28th Street while the sheet music business boomed here at the turn of the 20th century. The designation of this row of five buildings also represents the diverse history of Tin Pan Alley, acknowledging the harsh realities faced by African Americans at the turn of the 20th century, as well as their achievements. Tin Pan Alley's music publishing brought ragtime to an international public, and Jewish and African-American artists and publishers were able to create new and unprecedented opportunities for themselves in mainstream American music.

"The following biography was provided by “Spectrum: Home and School Magazine.” 

Harriet Tubman was born Harriet Ross in Dorchester County, Maryland in 1820. Her parents were from the Ashanti tribe of West Africa, and they worked as slaves on the Brodas plantation. In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5.  
Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts.  

In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman's cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister.  
 

Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason-Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet's trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister's family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York.  

By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the ""Moses of her people"" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves.  

With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled “Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman”, published in 1869 were a great financial help.  

In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died of pneumonia. She was 93 years old.  

Harriet Tubman was not afraid to fight for the rights of African-Americans. Her story is one of dedication and inspiration. During her lifetime Harriet was honored by many people. In 1897, her bravery even inspired Queen Victoria to award her a silver medal.

"""I'm a personality as well as an actress,"" Katharine Hepburn once declared. ""Show me an actress who isn't a personality, and you'll show me a woman who isn't a star."" Hepburn's bold, distinctive personality was apparent almost from birth. She inherited from her doctor father and suffragette mother her three most pronounced traits: an open and ever-expanding mind, a healthy body (maintained through constant rigorous exercise), and an inability to tell anything less than the truth.  

Hepburn was more a personality than an actress when she took the professional plunge after graduating from Bryn Mawr in 1928; her first stage parts were bits, but she always attracted attention with her distinct New England accent and her bony, sturdy frame. The actress' outspokenness lost her more jobs than she received, but, in 1932, she finally scored on Broadway with the starring role in The Warrior's Husband. She didn't want to sign the film contract offered her by RKO, so she made several ""impossible"" demands concerning salary and choice of scripts. The studios agreed to her terms, and, in 1932, she made her film debut opposite John Barrymore in A Bill of Divorcement (despite legends to the contrary, the stars got along quite well). Critical reaction to Hepburn's first film set the tone for the next decade: Some thought that she was the freshest and most original actress in Hollywood, while others were irritated by her mannerisms and ""artificial"" speech patterns. For her third film, Morning Glory (1933), Hepburn won the first of her four Oscars. But despite initial good response to her films, Hepburn lost a lot of popularity during her RKO stay because of her refusal to play the ""Hollywood game."" She dressed in unfashionable slacks and paraded about without makeup; refused to pose for pinup pictures, give autographs, or grant interviews; and avoided mingling with her co-workers. As stories of her arrogance and self-absorption leaked out, moviegoers responded by staying away from her films. The fact that Hepburn was a thoroughly dedicated professional -- letter-perfect in lines, completely prepared and researched in her roles, the first to arrive to the set each day and the last to leave each evening -- didn't matter in those days, when style superseded substance.  

Briefly returning to Broadway in 1933's The Lake, Hepburn received devastating reviews from the same critics who found her personality so bracing in The Warrior's Husband. The grosses on her RKO films diminished with each release -- understandably so, since many of them (Break of Hearts [1935], Mary of Scotland [1936]) were not very good. She reclaimed the support of RKO executives after appearing in the moneymaking Alice Adams (1935) -- only to lose it again by insisting upon starring in Sylvia Scarlett (1936), a curious exercise in sexual ambiguity that lost a fortune. Efforts to ""humanize"" the haughty Hepburn personality in Stage Door (1937) and the delightful Bringing Up Baby (1938) came too late; in 1938, she was deemed ""box-office poison"" by an influential exhibitor's publication. Hepburn's career might have ended then and there, but she hadn't been raised to be a quitter. She went back to Broadway in 1938 with a part written especially for her in Philip Barry's The Philadelphia Story. Certain of a hit, she bought the film rights to the play; thus, when it ended up a success, she was able to negotiate her way back into Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. Produced by MGM in 1940, the film version was a box-office triumph, and Hepburn had beaten the ""poison"" label.  

In her next MGM film, Woman of the Year (1942), Hepburn co-starred with Spencer Tracy, a copacetic teaming that endured both professionally and personally until Tracy's death in 1967. After several years of off-and-on films, Hepburn scored another success with 1951's The African Queen, marking her switch from youngish sophisticates to middle-aged character leads. After 1962's Long Day's Journey Into Night, Hepburn withdrew from performing for nearly five years, devoting her attention to her ailing friend and lover Tracy. She made the last of her eight screen appearances with Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), which also featured her niece Katharine Houghton. Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film, and her third the following year for A Lion in Winter; the fourth was bestowed 13 years later for On Golden Pond (1981). When she came back to Broadway for the 1969 musical Coco, Hepburn proved that the years had not mellowed her; she readily agreed to preface her first speech with a then-shocking profanity, and, during one performance, she abruptly dropped character to chew out an audience member for taking flash pictures. Hepburn made the first of her several television movies in 1975, co-starring with Sir Laurence Olivier in Love Among the Ruins -- and winning an Emmy award, as well. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1976's A Matter of Gravity.  

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hepburn continued to star on TV and in films, announcing on each occasion that it would be her last performance. She also began writing books and magazine articles, each of them an extension of her personality: self-centered, well-organized, succinct, and brutally frank (especially regarding herself). While she remained a staunch advocate of physical fitness, Hepburn was plagued by a progressive neurological disease which caused her head to shake uncontrollably -- an affliction she blithely incorporated into her screen characters. In 1994, Warren Beatty coaxed Hepburn out of her latest retirement to appear as his aristocratic grand-aunt in Love Affair. Though appearing frailer than usual, Katharine Hepburn was in complete control of herself and her craft, totally dominating her brief scenes. And into her nineties and on the threshold of her tenth decade, Katharine Hepburn remained the consummate personality, actress, and star. 

On June 29, 2003 Katharine Hepburn died of natural causes in Old Saybrook, Connetticut. She was 96.  Biography by Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide, Yahoo! Movies.

"Sometime in the 1920’s streets throughout the area of Douglaston, Queens and Little Neck, Queens were given numerical designations in order to come “in line” with the New York City street grid.  In 1970-1971, a movement to re-instate the named streets was achieved through the efforts of then Councilman Matthew Troy.  The Department of Transportation made the required changes back to the named streets over a five to six year period.  These changes were official map changes at the time.

Motivated by their grief and the warning her death represented, the residents of the East Village united to lobby the city’s utilities to ensure these dangers would be eliminated.

"The following biographical information is excerpted form an obituary printed in the New York Times on December 20,1996 and from materials provided by Homecrest Presbyterian Church. 

Rev. David M. Cory was born on February 10, 1903 in Manhattan.  He graduated form Columbia University in 1923 and from the New College of Edinburgh, Scotland in 1926.  He received a Masters Degree from Columbia University and a doctorate in theology form Union Theological Seminary in 1931.

He also served for 29 years as pastor of the Cuyler Presbyterian Church at 360 Pacific Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. 

As a young man, he was beaten while accompanying workers passing out union literature.  That beating caused the permanent impairment of the sight in his left eye.  In 1931, he was defeated as the Socialist Party candidate for the State Assembly.  He also ran for Borough President and Congress. 

In the 1930’s, Mohawk Indians who lived on a reservation near Montreal, Canada were brought to New York City to be ironworkers for the construction of the Triborough Bridge. Many lived in Brooklyn to be close to the ironworker’s union headquarters and attended Cuyler Presbyterian Church on Sundays.  Dr. Cory learned to speak their Monhawk-Oneida language and helped to prepare an Indian hymn. 

For many years, Rev. Cory was President of the Iceberg Athletic Club, whose members annually participate in mid-winter swims in the Atlantic Ocean.  He also painted landscapes and read widely about history. 

Dr. Cory was survived by his wife of 40 years, Elsie, and his sons Daniel, David, John, and his daughter Mina.

"This co-naming will commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Easter Rising against Britain’s rule over Ireland.  On April 24, 1916, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret organization of Irish nationalists, launched an armed uprising against British rule referred to as the Easter Rebellion.  Assisted by militant Irish socialists, the groups rioted and attacked British provincial government headquarters across Dublin and seized the Irish capital’s General Post Office.  They proclaimed the independence of Ireland, which had been under the repressive thumb of the United Kingdom for centuries, and by the next morning were in control of much of the city.  Later that day, however, British authorities launched a counteroffensive, and by April 29 the uprising had ended.  The Easter Rebellion is considered a significant marker on the road to establishing an independent Irish republic.

"Ms. Etheline Dubin was a great pioneer of change within the District 8 community; she was not afraid to speak out against injustice or to speak out for change.  Ms. Dubin fought diligently to maintain the integrity of the District 8 community and to make sure it progressed forward, and not backward. 

As 1st Vice Chair of Community Board 8, Ms. Dubin often co-chaired the Community Board meetings under the leadership of Mrs. Ruth G. Goring.  As a dutiful Community Board member as well as active resident, she was concerned with overall welfare of community; however, she was especially concerned with economic development and fostering economic vitality in our community; housing—she was the Chairperson of the Housing/ULURP Committee for several years and assisted the District Manager on housing inspections; youth and education—she was committed to the youth in the District and during the holidays, she sponsored events to make sure that each child at the St. John’s Recreation Center received gifts.  She also worked with Parkway Stuyvesant Day Camp to make sure the children were taken on education and fun trips.  

For 26 years, Etheline Dubin served as a member of Community Board No. 8; however, her diligence within the community neither began nor ended with her membership on the Board.  She lived on Lincoln Place between Classon and Washington Avenues for over 40 years, and fought hard to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood by speaking out against employment and housing discrimination, and battled to keep the Franklin Avenue Shuttle from being dismantled.  In addition to fighting for our institutions, she also fought for individual residents, attempting to make sure they were not taken advantage of. 

Ms. Dubin was a true leader, both by words and by example.  She fostered in the community during her time on the Board, a lasting desire for positive change.  Her fiery temperament and desire to voice her opinion to those that needed to hear it, made Ms. Dubin the community legend that she has become today.

"James Earle “Jimmy” Breslin was a native New Yorker, award-winning journalist, and American author. He was born in Queens and later brought a unique perspective to his writing and was known as a “street reporter” for his ability to communicate the thoughts and needs of New York’s working class.  He dedicated his life to using journalism as a means to a more just society, whether it was reporting on crime, or the struggles of the American working class, his veracious voice left an imprint on New York. His reporting on the “Son of Sam” killings and on the scandals of Borough President Donald Manes undoubtedly demonstrates the way he was never afraid to uncover the truth. While at the Daily News, his reporting earned him numerous accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary and the George Polk Award for Metropolitan Reporting; but perhaps his greatest achievement was elevating New York’s class consciousness. He used his position to raise the voices of those who had gone unheard, and for that he is remembered as a champion of the people. He served as the voice of this city for over 60 years as a lead columnist and was considered a leader in ""New Journalism.""  His portrayal of President John F. Kennedy’s gravedigger changed the face of journalism, and gave Americans an understanding of working-class life. This style of reporting, now referred to as the “Gravedigger Theory,” is taught in journalism schools across the country, proving that his influence spans lifetimes. He has amassed over 6,000 newspaper columns; 1,500 major magazine pieces; and 20 books; three of them bestsellers.

"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. envisioned a nation in which justice, dignity and decency were possible for all Americans. He was a great leader who served as a catalyst and voice for the American Civil Rights Movement. Born in Atlanta on January 15, 1929, he was the second child of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King. A highly motivated child, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Morehouse College to study religion at age 15. He was a junior in college when he was ordained a minister and made the assistant pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church.  

In 1948, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Crozier Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he began to seriously study the life and work of Mohandas K. Ghandi. ""I came to see for the first time,"" King wrote, ""that the Christian doctrine of love, operating through the Ghandhian method of nonviolence, is one of the most potent weapons available to an oppressed people in the struggle for freedom.""  

While working toward his doctorate degree in Systematic Theology at Boston University, Martin Luther King, Jr. met and married Coretta Scott. In May, 1954, he became the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Dr. King was thrust into the forefront when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man. Her courage triggered the Montgomery Bus Boycott and created a citywide protest against local segregation laws. Dr. King organized the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and advised African-Americans to boycott buses and picket businesses who were in favor of segregation. In 1956, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's bus segregation laws were unconstitutional. The victory established Dr. King as a national leader and paved the way for desegregation in other areas, most notably in public schools systems around the country.  

In 1957, Dr. King helped organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to end segregation using non-violent protests. He led numerous demonstrations against discrimination including rallies, sit-ins, the Freedom Rides and voter registration drives. The most memorable of demonstrations was the 1963 March on Washington where he delivered his famed ""I Have A Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. These efforts received international acclaim and recognition when Dr. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Dr. King through his powerful and sincere speeches, renewed the hopes, determination and spirit of all people seeking to improve their own lives. He inspired some to advance the principles of humanity nationwide and around the world.  

Dr. King's last protest took place on March 28, 1968 when he led a march in Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking sanitation workers. He was assassinated seven days later on April 4, while staying at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.  

In 1985, President Reagan signed a proclamation declaring the third Monday in January a public holiday in honor of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  ",Bronx,Street,1061568000000.0,Seabrook,In its entirety ,"The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue       ",Bartow Avenue	,10475.0,1922.0,Int.

"Marion Castellano was born on September 5, 1925 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.  By the time she reached her eleventh birthday her father had passed away from pneumonia.  She began cleaning apartments at age eleven to help her family make ends meet and became a forewoman in a dress factory at age seventeen.  Marion learned responsibility at an early age and she became the secondary income to her mother as the middle child of three girls.  Being an adept seamstress from her years in the factory, Marion would donate clothing she made to the poorer families from her church, Our Lady of Solace.  When her parish's school was unable to afford desperately needed maintenance, Marion organized fundraisers and bake sales to assist them in reaching their goals.  During World War II, she worked making army field jackets to help in the war effort and became politically and socially aware during that turbulent time.  Marion married in 1946 and she and  her husband raised three children, living behind a candy store, which they opened on Bath Avenue in the late 1950’s.  As a small candy store owner, working seven days a week, Marion still found the time to become manager for the local little league team.  

Marion's community awareness expanded to the political arena in the 1960's when she became Captain of the 16th  Republican Assembly District of Kings County.  She was also a Kings County committeewoman and worked as a troubleshooter during elections for her district.  In 1965, being the natural organizer that she was, Marion began the Cropsey Park Concert Series, which drew thousands for free rock music events.  Speeches by Abe Stark, Louis Lefkowitz and Dizzy Gillespie, became commonplace.  To this day, these concerts are still being enjoyed each summer at the park.  In 1967, she and her husband Phil opened up Bath Music, located in Bensonhurst, which she operated until her passing.  Marion became the heart of the music scene in her community.  She would open at any hour to help a musician in need.  She tried to instill the strong ethics she had into them.  She worked through many troubled times with them, helping many to get help for their drug or alcohol addictions.  Mama and Papa, as she and her husband were commonly known, also donated instruments to local schools, churches, charitable organizations, and even to the police marching band.  Although she was kind, she was not a pushover.  Standing just 4’11”, she disarmed a 6’1” bandit who had come to rob her, by knocking the gun out of his hand and kicking him to the ground.  This was chronicled in several local papers. 

Marion kept a community bulletin board in her store and would refer people in need to the proper City agency.  Children particularly moved her.  Any child in need became one of hers.  She helped to reunite a runaway, who was in a cult, with her parents.  She worked personally with mentally and emotionally challenged children from the neighborhood.  She worked to get them benefits, to have them removed from abusive households, and get them settled in community homes, or in some instances, apartments of their own.  She helped Chin and Leroy Chow for over 25 years, after their families abandoned them.  She was a lifesaver, literally.  A woman passing the store started screaming and panicking when she saw that her infant child had choked, stopped breathing, and was starting to turn blue.  Marion rushed to the carriage grabbed the baby by her feet and whacked her on the back, dislodging the blockage.  In countless cases, either running to help people in accidents on her busy avenue, assisting people fallen from epilepsy, or just coming to the aid of those who could not help themselves, Marion knew the solution to each problem was to get involved. 

Marion Castellano died on March 1, 2000.  Over a thousand people attended her wake and flowers overflowed four rooms and wrapped around the foyer of the funeral parlor.  The wake had to be extended an extra day and the funeral director at Miraglia Chapels exclaimed that in his thirty years he had never seen such an overwhelming amount of respect.  She was selfless throughout her life, and never looked for acknowledgement for her countless good deeds.  She was the backbone of her community.

"The following information is from the McClung Museum exhibition “Cartier: The Jewler’s Art” at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

Founded in 1847 in Paris by Louis-François Cartier, the firm became one of the world's greatest designers and manufacturers of jewelry and objets d'art, and a supplier to royalty, nobility, and millionaires. 

Until the end of the 19th century, Cartier was primarily a retailer of jewelry and objects produced by outside manufacturers. When Cartier's son Alfred took over in 1874, the firm gradually began repairing and improving jewelry, and then designing and manufacturing their own original pieces in the late 1800’s. In 1899, the move to 13 Rue de la Paix situated the business in the heart of the important jewelry and couturier quarter of Paris. 

Encouraged by King Edward VII, Cartier opened a branch in London in 1902 managed by Alfred's son Jacques. A royal commission was granted in 1904, followed quickly by commissions from Spain, Portugal, Russia, Siam, and Greece. These royal commissions helped to solidify Cartier's reputation among the wealthy and famous the world over. 

To better deal with American millionaires, who from the beginning formed a large part of Cartier's clientele, a New York branch was opened in 1909 by Alfred's other son, Pierre. Until World War I, Cartier maintained close relations with clients in Russia, and the princes and maharajas of India sought Cartier to design and mount their jewels. Jewelry and accessories were also made as stock items for the stores or were commissioned by individuals. 

Until the 1960’s, the Paris, London, and New York branches were part of a single firm but operated independently, collaborating whenever necessary. In 1962, the New York branch was sold, followed by the Paris branch in 1965, thus ending the unity. The firm was reunited and reorganized in 1979 as Cartier Monde, and today shops and boutiques can be found in cities around the world. 

With each of the branches headed by a Cartier brother, the first four decades of the 20th century were a time of originality in design and technique in which a distinctive Cartier aesthetic emerged.  The name change is in recognition of the historic business relationship between the City of New York and Cartier Jewelers.  Pierre Cartier, the founder of the New York company for the Cartier family, lived on 52nd Street in the house where the business is now located.  The home was originally purchased with a Cartier necklace.

"The following biographical material was supplied by the Cifichiello family.
John Cifichiello, the son of Italian immigrants Vito and Rosa Cifichiello, was 
born at home in a New York City Greenwich Village apartment on August 24, 1906. At a 
young age his family, which grew to four boys and four girls, moved to the Fordham 
section of The Bronx where the family prospered and eventually bought their own home 
on Crotona Avenue. John worked in the printing trade and married Caroline Ciani, with 
whom he raised a son John and a daughter Carolyn. During World War II, he served in 
the United States Navy, in Ireland and England, and upon his discharge began a career 
with the United States Postal Service.
After the war John Cifichiello was a member, and later Commander, of the 
Catholic War Veterans, escorting veterans to Mass each Sunday at the Kingsbridge VA 
Hospital. He was also active in Mt. Carmel Church’s Holy Name Society and the St.

Christopher J. Pickford was born on Father’s Day, June 15, 1969, in, what was then, Booth Memorial Hospital in Flushing. Hew grew up in Kew Gardens in the home in which his parents, Thomas and Linda still reside. He attended Public School 90, Junior High School 226, Forest Hills High School and Queens Borough Community College. 

Beginning with his early years in grammar school, Chris was awarded honors in creative writing and music. These gifts remained his passion into his adult life. He was an accomplished guitarist and song writer and used these talents in several bands throughout the years. The first band was “Riboflavin and the Vitamin D’s” – a band formed in high school mostly just for fun, but soon gained a cult following throughout Queens for its witty lyrics and ridiculous stage presence. As he matured, his music did as well. He formed the band “10 Degree Lean”, appearing regularly in Manhattan’s East Village. He continued to write poetry and screen plays and began laying down tracks for an  acoustical guitar Cd. 

Chris worked for the Queens District Attorneys as a paralegal before being hired as a New York City Firefighter in January, 2000. He was assigned to Ladder Company 136 in Queens and was  on a rotation to Engine Company 201 in Brooklyn.

"Peter Magnani left an indelible mark on the built environment of Queens through his life’s work as an architect and city planner. He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area’s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City’s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. In 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter’s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City’s most successful Open Street projects. In 2002, he became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children’s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica, Queens, and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his “Beacon of Light” design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. “The idea is to use natural elements, such as the sun, wind and greenery on the roof to help insulate the building,” Peter wrote. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the Queens Borough Public Library into the 21st century by installing machines that library patrons could use to check out books on their own. In addition to his work as a city planner and builder, he played an instrumental role in the Towers Coop, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the coop’s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the “Cocaine Capital” by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to coop status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm. ",Queens,Street,1657900800000.0,Dromm,Between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue ,Peter Magnani Way ,81st Street ,11372.0,1957.0,Int.

"Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez was a mulatto or Black man from Santo Domingo (the Spanish island-colony also known as La Española in Spanish and as Hispaniola in English) that arrived in the Hudson River Harbor in 1613 as part of the crew of a merchant Dutch ship exploring the area for its trade potential.  After a few weeks in the area, the captain decided to return to Holland, but Rodriguez refused, arguing he was a free man and warning that if he was forced to go on the ship he would jump overboard.  His Dutch captain accepted his demands and in payment for the work done as part of the ship’s crew, Rodriguez was compensated with a number of hatchets, presumably to trade them with the local Algonquian Amerindians.  The ship left with the entire crew for Holland leaving Rodriguez in the area.  The following year, 1614, another Dutch merchant ship arrived in the Hudson, found Rodriguez, and hired him to assist in trading with the local Amerindians.  Shortly afterwards, the same captain that had brought over Rodriguez as sailor in 1613, arrived for a second time on a ship in the Hudson. A dispute erupted between the two Dutch captains and crews over the primacy in the right to trade with the local Amerindians. Rodriguez himself was involved in the scuffle.  Once the crews were back in Holland, they took their contention to court and a notarial record was generated with their depositions about the past events in the Hudson.  These depositions, held at the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, became the only source known so far on the story of Juan Rodriguez. They were first published by Simon Hart in 1959 in his book The prehistory of the New Netherland Company. (Amsterdam: City of Amsterdam Press).  No other documents have been found about the life of Rodriguez after 1614.  Further research work in archival documents pertaining to Hispaniola in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century conducted by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at The City College of New York have revealed the existence of a number of individuals with the name Juan Rodrigues or Rodriguez  (spelled indistinctly, with S or Z, in the Spanish documents) in the island-colony of Santo Domingo at the time, including three explicitly tried by the authorities for smuggling of goods with Dutch merchants in the island.  The historical record clearly shows Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez residing somewhere at the Hudson Bay area between 1613 and 1614.  As a result, Rodriguez is considered the first non-Amerindian person to ever have resided in what is today New York City.  The arrival of Juan Rodriguez in 1613 indicates that the Dominican/Latino population’s relationship with the second capital of the country, as New York is called, began many years ago and that those who left the country of origin afterwards merely followed the trail of Juan Rodriguez, first non-native man in residing in the city. A conclusive statement on the role played by Rodríguez is that in 1613 it had been expressly declared that no other member of the Dutch crew had stayed behind in the Hudson area.  This is confirmed by the documents found in the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, where the Dutch sailors declare that when the Dutch ship sailed away from the river, a mulatto born in Santo Domingo stayed ashore at the same place.

"School Settlement Association, Inc. finds its earliest incarnation in 1898, as a school affiliated organization called the Ridgewood Household Club.  Agnes E. Demonde, a public-school teacher, noted severe deficiencies in her student’s education and found it prudent to offer supplemental education in association with various local institutions of higher learning. 

Founded as School Settlement Association in 1901 and incorporated under that name in 1906, the organization was housed at 148 Jackson Street, just one block away from its present location.  Then in 1914, a generous donation from Ms. Elvia Zabriskio enabled School Settlement to move to a facility built specifically for it at 120 Jackson Street, the site School Settlement inhabits to this day. 

Although the neighborhood has changed during the past century, the situation of educational deficiency Ms. Demonde encountered still exists.  School Settlement has proven itself over the past hundred years to be an asset to the Williamsburg/Greenpoint community by assisting in the education of the community’s youth. 

At present, the programs and services offered to School Settlement’s participants are designed to round out and supplement the education local youth receive in public school.  Homework help, arts and crafts, computer instruction, literacy and structured recreation are only a sample of the programs School Settlement offers.  School Settlement also offers an AIDP program under the CAPS initiative within Automotive High School as well as a teen night program on-site, designed to offer youth an opportunity to feel relaxed, have fun and express themselves in a smoke-free, drug free and violence free environment. 

School Settlement has been in the same community for over a century and in the same location for almost eighty years.  It is difficult to imagine Williamsburg without it.

"Dr. Ahmad Jaber was born in the Palestinian village of Yamoun. He immigrated to the United States in 1974, and began his medical residency at Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where he was affiliated for his entire career. He became a board-certified OB-GYN and moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he remained for the rest of his life. Throughout the course of his career as an OBGYN, Dr. Jaber personally delivered over 5,000 babies. He established a private practice on 5th Avenue in Bay Ridge, where he became a mainstay of the community. Joining forces with a then-nascent community of Arab-American doctors in the United States, he founded the NYC Chapter of the National Arab-American Medical Association in 1988. In May of 2001, Dr. Jaber alongside other community leaders founded the Arab American Association of New York, which began in a small office on the second floor of Dr. Jaber’s 5th Avenue practice. The organization started as a one-room social service agency, and is now a well-established nonprofit and advocacy agency serving thousands of people a year. He remained on the Board of the organization his entire life. Dr. Jaber was also an Imam, who served at the State Street mosque in downtown Brooklyn, one of the oldest mosques in the United States. His religious and interfaith work touched many areas of New York City, through multiple organizations he helped to found or lead: the Al-Noor Islamic School, Beit Al-Maqdis Islamic Center, the Islamic Mission of America, the Arab Muslim American Federation, and the Brooklyn Heights Interfaith Clergy Association, among others. Above all, Dr. Jaber was known for his generosity and his reputation as a bridge builder.

He was civically active and often acted as a liaison to elected officials and institutions on behalf of the growing Arab and Muslim community.

"Big Brothers and Big Sisters of New York City (BBBSNYC) was founded in 1904, by Ernest Coulter, as the first formalized mentoring program in the United States. BBBSNYC provides youth, ranging in age from 7 to 18 years old, with one-on-one volunteers. These mentors have a dramatic, positive affect on their “littles’” lives, particularly in regards to school, self-esteem, relationships with family and friends, and resistance to drug use and crime. On average, these relationships last three years, while their friendships often last a lifetime. 

The agency’s success is due to its commitment to its on-on-one mentoring programs that provide long-term caring and support under the supervision and guidance of a professional social worker. 

While the Traditional Mentoring Program continues, reaching more boys and girls than ever, Coulter’s dedication to creative, new solutions also thrives here. BBBSNYC offers unique programs, tailored to fit the needs of diverse groups-corporate employees, single parents, or new Americans. And BBBSNYC’s Center for Training enables it to function as a “teaching hospital”, performing research and propagating the best practices of youth mentoring to nonprofits far and wide. BBSNYC is considered the forerunner for mentoring programs nationwide and today there are 450 Big Brother Big Sisters Agencies and an additional 50,000 organizations that mentor. These programs have proven to positively impact the futures of at-risk boys and girls.

"Toussaint Louverture, originally François Dominique, a Haitian general, now known as “the Precursor.” Born of slave parents near Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue (now Cap-Haïtien, Haiti), Toussaint was self-educated. He acted as physician to the insurgent army and became a leader of the Haitian slave revolt, a 1791 black slave uprising against the French colonial regime. After France abolished slavery in the territory in 1794, Toussaint supported the French rulers of the country against British invaders and was made a general in 1795. In 1801 he succeeded, after many struggles, in liberating Saint-Domingue from French control and became president for life of a new republic. In 1802 Napoleon sent troops under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Victor Emmanuel Leclerc, to subdue the Haitians. Toussaint was defeated, captured, and accused of conspiracy. He was taken to France, where he was imprisoned at Fort-de-Joux, and died the next year. He is honored today as one of the founders and heroes of Haiti.

"D’Aja Naquai Robinson was 14 years old when she was killed by a stray bullet while riding a Q6 bus on Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens.  She was the unintended victim of a gang dispute.  It served as the impetus for the launch of the city’s Gun Violence Crisis Management System (also known as “CMS”) the following year.  Originating from the Chicago-born Cure Violence public health crisis model, which New York City first adopted in 2012, CMS concentrates its resources on seventeen specific police precincts where 51% of shootings occur, citywide. Nearly $20 million dollars in funding has been provided to CMS and its Cure Violence partners since its 2014 launch, and they have been credited with reducing the rate of shootings in neighborhoods all across the five boroughs.  In the South Jamaica catchment area that is overseen by Cure Violence organization LIFE Camp Inc., more than 500 consecutive days without a single shooting have elapsed.  The lives that have been saved through the efforts of CMS can be attributed to the public outrage at the untimely death of D’Aja Naquai Robinson.

"Alex Pauline was a well-known figure in the lives of many in Rochdale Village. As a child of “Circle 4”, he grew up playing basketball in South Rochdale Playground with his brothers and friends. This playground and the adjacent school, PS80Q meant everything to Mr. Pauline for several reasons.  His entire, extended family attended Public School 80Q and as an adult, he never left the area, becoming the school custodian, a teacher and the basketball coach at the school. His workdays would begin at 7 a.m. in the classroom and end at 10 p.m. with his custodial work. In 1988, he created a non-profit basketball program called “Drug Free That’s Me” that was held on weekends on the full basketball court in South Rochdale Playground. “Drug Free That’s Me” was a program that provided alternatives to drug abuse and crime, which often plagued the community. The afterschool program not only taught basketball and all aspects of the game, but also educated the youth on the detrimental effects of drug use, the importance of education, and life itself. “Coach Al” was a father figure to his students, the neighborhood kids and his basketball players. Nine months after Mr. Pauline’s passing, the first annual ""Drug Free That's Me Day in Memory of Al Pauline"" took place with several players that participated in Drug Free That's Me when they were kids. The summer basketball tournament ""B.A.C.E"" at the neighboring park presents the ""Al Pauline Award"" to the player that averages the most points throughout the summer basketball tournaments. In addition, Coach Al Pauline’s program had a cameo on TV One series “Uncensored” that featured former NBA star Lamar Odom who had participated in my father’s program. Many in the community still say when the look at PS80Q they think of “Coach Al.” ",Queens,Street,1657900800000.0,Adams,Between Bedell Street and 176th Street ,Alex Pauline Road ,134th Road ,11434.0,2032.0,Int.

"Margaret Corbin has been an unsung hero of the Revolutionary War.  She was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.  In 1776, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, she accompanied her husband, John Corbin, to his post in charge of a small cannon on a ridge later named Fort Tryon.  It was at this battle station that he was killed during an assault by the Hessians.

In 1779, Congress declared her the first woman pensioner of the new nation.  She was buried at West Point with full military honors in recognition of her service in action.

"MacNeil Mitchell, (July 18, 1904 – December 17, 1996) was a New York state senator who sponsored legislation that helped to create 150,000 units of middle-income housing around the state of New York.

He served nine years in the Assembly and 18 years in the Senate representing Manhattan's old Silk Stocking District on the East Side.

Mitchell and Lama sponsored the Mitchell-Lama housing law, which was passed in 1955. It transformed the city's housing landscape, allowing private developers and nonprofit organizations to receive large property tax abatements and low-interest mortgages backed either by city or state bonds. In return, the building owners agreed to limit their profits and keep rents low.  The Mitchell-Lama plan was developed in response to the lack of affordable rentals and co-op housing for white-collar workers at a time when government programs focused on building low-income housing.

"Mary Sarro was a Community Board 3 District Manager for nearly four decades.  She was very active in the Jackson Heights community.  She worked at the 1964-1965 World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, and as a social secretary for Edward Bronfman, of the Seagram’s liquor empire.  She joined Community Board 3 in 1974 and worked as an unpaid secretary for community planning boards.  She helped plant trees, create community gardens and increase the safety and well-being of her neighbors.  The community board fought successfully for a new police precinct for Jackson Heights, the 115th Precinct, and for neighborhood preservation through the establishment of a Jackson Heights Historic District and the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.  She advocated for enforcement of livery cabs, new schools for the overcrowded district and improved relations with officials at the Port Authority and LaGuardia Airport, as well as dozens of quality of life issues including LGBT rights in the area.  In 2010, she stepped down from CB3 but remained active in the community, serving as the sergeant-at-arms for the 115th Precinct Community Council and as a member of the North Queens Homeowners Civic Association, the United Community Civic Association and the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.  She was also a founder of the Catherine M. Sheridan Senior Citizen Center and was instrumental in creating the 82nd Street Business Improvement District.

"Legendary punk rocker Joey Ramone, the front man for America's premier punk band, the Ramones, died at the age of 49.  Born Jeffrey Hyman on May 19, 1951 in Forest Hills, Queens, the gawky geek decked out in sunglasses and black leather would found the Ramones in 1974, with friends Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy.  Each adopted the surname Ramone, after a stage name (Ramon) used by Paul McCartney during the earliest Beatles days. 

Best known for such two-minute anthems as “I Wanna Be Sedated,” “Blitzkrieg Bop” “Rockaway Beach” and “Teenage Lobotomy,” the Ramones are credited with founding what would later be dubbed “punk rock.”  According to legend, it was all an accident.  Novices on their instruments, the quartet knew four chords and played them at breakneck speed to prevent listeners from discerning the mistakes.  An average concert consisted of about three dozen songs in about 90 minutes.   

Punk caught on and found a home at the downtown Manhattan club CBGBs, where the Ramones performed with like-minded souls Richard Hell, Patti Smith and Television.  After a Ramones tour in 1976, the genre spread to England, where the Sex Pistols and Damned copied what they saw but added a more rebellious edge. 

In 1979, the Ramones appeared in the Roger Corman movie Rock 'n' Roll High School, recording the title song for the soundtrack.  Ten years later they contributed the title track to Pet Cemetery, based on the book by Stephen King.  But mainstream crossover success consistently eluded them.  Although their fiercely delivered, wincingly inane pop songs about social misfits were hailed as rock classics, none ever cracked the Top 40.  The Ramones commercial profile consistently paled in comparison to each new generation of groups they inspired--from the Clash and Blondie, through the Offspring and Green Day (two of whose members named children after the Ramones) and now Blink-182 and Fenix TX. 

Over 22 years and several lineup changes the Ramones recorded 13 albums.  They released their last, “Adios Amigos,” and broke up in 1996, after performing a farewell show – their 2,263rd – with guests including Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell. 

Joey Ramone died of lymphatic cancer on April 15, 2001, which he had been battling for about seven years.  He died in his hospital bed, and is said to have passed when U2’s “A Little While” concluded.  Not only was he the front man for his band, he was the front man of a generation of punk rockers.  More than any of his contemporaries, Joey Ramone was the figurehead for the New York punk scene that spawned many favorite bands.

"Mary Mitchell served the community during the most difficult years of the 1960's, 70's and 80's. She did it from an old garment warehouse where The Mary Mitchell Family and Youth Center now stands. She served the East Tremont Avenue and Crotona Avenue communities with dedication and loyalty that gave families opportunities that would have not been available to them. In 1997, the Mary Mitchell Center opened. The Center has developed after school youth programs, created The Food Justice Club and supports the effort of over 25 small, volunteer-run groups. Members of the Mary Mitchell Center Board have fought for thirty years to have vacant lots turned into ball fields and community gardens and to see local parks restored for soccer, tennis and football. Now, the Center provides many opportunities for youth and families during 2020 among the pandemic. In the late 1970’s Crotona, located in the South Bronx, was burning due to arson and property abandonment. Homes and buildings were reduced to rubble and the neighborhood had hundreds of vacant lots.

The last burial occurred in 1898, the same year that the City of New York consolidated and abolished the Town of Flushing. In 1914, the site was given to the Parks Department. A playground was built above the remains in 1936 despite reports from 1919 and 1931 documenting that the site held marble headstones.

"Willie Mays was born on May 6, 1931, in Westfield, Alabama, and began playing baseball at an early age. He played in the minor leagues for two seasons and was picked up by the New York Giants in 1951.  Although having no hits in his first twelve at bats, he finally hit a home run over the left field fence of the Polo Grounds and from then on, his batting average improved throughout the season and won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award.  In the 1951 World Series, Mays was part of the first all-African-America outfield in major league history along with Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin in game one of the series.  Mays was drafted by the United States Army in 1952 during the Korean War and missed most of the 1952 season and all of the 1953 season.  He returned to the Giants in 1954 and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year.  Also, the Giants won the National League pennant and went on to dominate in the 1954 World Series.  In this series, Mays made an over-the-shoulder running grab referred to as, “The Catch,” which is considered the iconic image of his career and one of baseball’s most memorable fielding plays which prevented two runners from scoring.  In 1955, he led the league with 51 home runs and in 1956, he hit 36 home runs and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player to join the 30-30 Club.  In 1957, he won the first of twelve consecutive Gold Glove Awards and also became the fourth player in Major League history to join the 20-20-20 Club.  He also stole 38 bases that year and became the second player in baseball history to reach 20 in each of those four categories, doubles, triples, home runs, steals in the same season.  After the 1957 season, Mays moved with the Giants franchise to San Francisco.  One of his best games was on April 30, 1961 when Mays hit four home runs against the Milwaukee Braves.  In 1970, Mays was named the 1960’s “Player of the Decade.”  In 1972, Mays was traded to the New York Mets where he retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 with 660 home runs, 7,095 fielding putouts in the outfield which remains the major league record and played in 24 All-Star games.  

After his retirement, Mays continued working with the New York Mets as a hitting instructor until the 1979 season.  Later on, he became a full-time special assistant to the Giants for over 25 years and served on the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team helping former players with finances and medical issues.  He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in January 1979 and every May 24th in San Francisco is celebrated as Willie Mays Day.  He was also very involved with his charity, the Say Hey Foundation which is dedicated to helping underprivileged youth.  In addition, he is involved in charitable events such as the Giants Community Fund, the San Francisco Food Bank and the Whitney Young Child Development Center in Hunter’s Point.  He has also received honorary degrees from Ohio State University, Ohio and Yale University, Connecticut and Mills College and Dartmouth.  He was honored by Major League Baseball and the Giants at the 2007 All-Star game for his lifetime achievements and was also honored with the Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point officially becoming the Willie Mays Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point after the clubhouse was rebuilt.

"Rabbi Joseph Weber was born in 1931 in Mako, (Makava) Hungary. Weber and his family were rounded up and deported to a converted brick factory in a makeshift ghetto in the nearby city of Sered. Two months later, they boarded the cattle cars that were destined for Auschwitz, but were diverted to Mannersdorf, a camp near Strasburg, Austria. From there, they were sent to a Zunderlager, a family camp in Bergen Belsen where Joseph's Bar Mitzvah took place in Cheshvan of 1944. After the liberation, they made their way back home to Mako, but their home had been destroyed so they traveled to Budapest. They settled in Budapest where his father and two brothers passed away shortly after due to the ravages of war. Joseph and his younger brother left Budapest, leaving their mother and four sisters behind, and made their way to Antwerp to their Rabbi, who had moved there after the war. Around 1950, the Rabbi sent them to learn with his own Rabbi, the saintly Reb Aron of Belz in Tel Aviv. From there they moved to Canada, where they lived and learned in the Pupa Yeshiva. After receiving a visa to New York around 1953, he arrived at his final destination, fulfilling his dream to be reunited with his Rabbi in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Williamsburg in the early 1950's consisted mostly of broken survivors, who had lost most of their relatives in war-torn Europe. At 22 years-old, he became the Rabbi's right-hand man, learning a new language through correspondence courses, and establishing the Mosdos with clarity and alacrity.

"Father Thomas A. Lynch was born and raised in the Bronx along with his six siblings. He grew up in the Parish of San Nicolás de Tolentino and attended school there. He went to the cathedral preparatory seminary, where he began to think about a vocation to the priesthood. He attended Manhattan College while pursuing his calling at St. John Neuman Residence. After his studies at the San José Seminary, he was ordained by Cardinal O'Connor on May 16, 1992. In between his summer assignments while in formation, he lived for two months at Christ the King Parish in Marcy Place, where he witnessed firsthand the joys and challenges of being a priest in a Hispanic parish. His first assignment as parochial vicar was at Holy Family Parish in Castle Hill in the Bronx. After two wonderful years there, he was assigned to study Church History at the Catholic University of America in Washington DC. Cardinal O'Connor then assigned Father Lynch to San José Seminary as a professor of Church History and integrated him into the Advisory Council of Priests to the Rector of the Seminary.

"The Brooklyn Heritage Association has requested that this supplemental street name be added to honor a piece of road that had a historical role in the American Revolution.  At that time, and until the adoption of the modern street grid in the Town of Flatbush, Martense Lane was a colonial-era dirt road that connected the Gowanus Road at 35th Street and Fourth Avenue with the Flatbush Road (now Avenue) at the Dutch Reformed Church.  Martense was one of the principal British routes of advance.  Starting from Gravesend, the British center marched to New Utrecht, near the Dutch Reformed Church, and then north.  This force, mostly Hessians and Scots Highlanders, turned east and proceeded down Church Lane (now Avenue) to the Dutch Reformed Church, where they camped.  They skirmished with the Americans, and the Continental Army burned the Lefferts Homestead.  The next day they proceeded up Flatbush Road to attack the Americans at Battle Pass in Prospect Park.

"Joan Maynard’s life work was preserving a 19th century settlement of free blacks in Brooklyn.  She was the driving force behind the preservation of Weeksville, the pre-Civil War community of freed slaves on the edge of Crown Heights, just south of Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Despite having no official training as a preservationist, Maynard charged on, and succeeded in reintroducing the country to a once-thriving Brooklyn community that included New York’s first black police officer and first black female physician.  She was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 29, 1928, and graduated from Empire State College of the State University of New York.  In 1968, four small cottages were discovered on the edge of Crown Heights that are believed to be all that remained of Weeksville, which dates to 1838.  Through efforts led by Maynard, schoolchildren and a small group of volunteers, the houses were designated a city landmark in 1970 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  She was the founding member of the Weeksville Society, where as president and later executive director she oversaw several renovations to the houses over the years.  In 2004, the most extensive of the renovations were completed. In 2012, the Weeksville houses were opened to the public following their $3 million renovation.

"The following biographical information was provided by Community Board 9 in the Bronx and the Office of the Bronx Borough President. 

Steve Mercado was born on June 1, 1963 and grew up playing stickball on the streets of The Bronx. He was widely known for his efforts to preserve and promote stickball as a healthy and accessible sport. From a young player on Bronx streets, he became a nationally recognized leader and organizer, establishing leagues in the Bronx, across the City and across the Country, including Miami, San Diego and Puerto Rico. Steve Mercado was a very civically active member of Community Board 9 who volunteered a great deal of his time to The Bronx YMCA as a coach. He also served as the President of the Emperors Stickball League which plays every weekend from March until August on Stickball Boulevard. 

Steve Mercado became a New York City Firefighter on October 21, 1990 and received a unit citation on October 24, 1996. His commitment to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) was every bit as intense as his commitment to stickball. Assigned to Engine Company 40 on Manhattan’s West Side, Steve was called to the World Trade Center in answer to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. He died on that day along with 342 other members of FDNY. Steve Mercado was thirty-eight years old. He left a widow, Jovianna, and two sons, Sklyer, 6, and Austin, 2.

"The following material was provided by the Ramblersville-Hawtree Civic Association and drawn from the Tribune (November 9-15, 2000). 

Residents of the Ramblersville-Hawtree community have requested that the name of the “102nd Street-Lenihan’s Bridge” be changed to honor seven young men from the area who died while serving their country during World War II. The bridge, built in October 1931, was originally named in honor of the then-state Assemblyman. However, present day residents feel that it would be more meaningful to re-name the bridge “The Ramblersville-Hawtree Memorial Bridge” to honor the area’s seven fallen World War II heroes. 

Over fifty years ago, seven young men from the seaside community of Ramblersville left their homes to serve their country in wartime. Tom Beckwith, Henry Schmitt, Albert Nelson, Edward O’Reilly, Walter Meliere, Paul Pfeiffer and James Talley, all under the age of 25, would never return.

"Mrs. Clara Hale better known as “Mommy” Hale was considered a savior to many. Born in April 1 1905, she was raised to be a nurturing, loving, and comforting woman. In 1940, she fostered children in her five-room apartment. As problems with the drug abuse problem increased in the Harlem community, she heeded to babies addicted to heroin before birth. Soon after, she helped established sound homes for these infants. It was the first and only known program in the United States designed to deal with infants born addicted to illegal drugs. In 1975, Hale House became the Center for the Promotion of Human Potential,” a certified voluntary childcare agency. At that point in time, it was the only black voluntary organization in the country. 

A vast amount of the general public mourned her death on December 18 1992, but her legacy still carries on.

"This information is taken from an essay by Clarence Page.  It is located at http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/jan-june02/poverty_5-06.html.  

In 1965, Claude Brown gave poverty another face, a big city face, with his autobiographical novel Manchild in the Promised Land. Vivid, violent, and unsentimental, Brown called it a novel, but it was his story, beginning with him getting shot, and running from the cops. ""I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it."" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies.  

The '60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America's cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown's Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground.  

His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown's Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, ""which is still finding Claude Browns,"" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared.  

Claude Brown's story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the ""cycle of poverty,"" they said, for the ""urban underclass,"" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution.  

Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope.  

Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone's payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land.

"Sugar Ray Robinson was born in Ailey, Georgia, and moved to New York with his family when he was a teenager to escape the prevalent prejudice in the South. It was in a Harlem gym that he was first introduced to boxing.  When his future coach George Gainford watched him box for the first time, Gainford commented that the young boxer's style and fluid motions were sweet as sugar and the nickname stuck for the rest of his career.  He won the New York Golden Gloves championship in 1940 and at the age of 19 turned pro and became the world welterweight champion in 1946.  Sugar Ray's record was 128-1-2 with 84 knockouts at the pinnacle of his career. In over 200 fights, Sugar Ray was never physically knocked out although he did receive one technical KO. Altogether, he amassed 109 KOs, and finished with a record of 175-19-6 with two no-decisions and is considered one of the best boxers of all time.

"Irene Klementowicz was born in the Bronx and later moved to Greenpoint, Brooklyn with her family. It was around this same time that Irene began noticing the amount of soot that was being deposited on her windows every day, a result of the Greenpoint incinerator that opened the same year. She also could not help but notice the odors emanating from a chemical company across the street from her children's school, SS. Cyril & Methodius. She realized that these odors could contain chemicals that could harm all the children who attended the parochial school as well as P.S. 31 right next door. She sprang into action and the chemical company was forced to place anti-pollution controls on the exhaust stacks located on its roof. She started on the Greenpoint Incinerator next. It was here that her values of hard work and perseverance were really tested, since the battle was waged 35 long years until the Incinerator was finally closed in 1994.

"Toussaint Louverture, originally François Dominique, a Haitian general, now known as “the Precursor.” Born of slave parents near Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue (now Cap-Haïtien, Haiti), Toussaint was self-educated. He acted as physician to the insurgent army and became a leader of the Haitian slave revolt, a 1791 black slave uprising against the French colonial regime. After France abolished slavery in the territory in 1794, Toussaint supported the French rulers of the country against British invaders and was made a general in 1795. In 1801 he succeeded, after many struggles, in liberating Saint-Domingue from French control and became president for life of a new republic.
